            * You do not learn something better if you figure it out for yourself
            * Learning styles are a myth
            * If you give students choice over how they learn, the often choose the least effective method
            * Testing is a highly effective way to boost learning
            * The evidence for the effectiveness of whole-class, interactive explicit teaching comes from a wide range of studies
            * Broad world knowledge is essential to reading comprehension
            * You cannot just Google facts when you need them
            * Achievement boosts motivation


Brings together many other modern working theories.

        1. Daily Review
        2. New material in small steps
        3. Ask questions - check understanding
        4. Model worked examples
        5. Guide practice - time to rephrase/summarise
        6. Check all student understanding
        7. Aim for 80% success rate
        8. Scaffold difficult tasks
        9. Independent practice - over-leaning
        10. Weekly/Monthly review

TASK: Discuss Critically - 
Rosenshine if the best, research proven strategy to learning. Entire schools call themselves Rosenshine schools.
What could be the problems with this?

* Gibbs 2020 - cautioned about Rosenshines principles being used in every classroom ever lesson limited the teachers creativity

* [Does research on retrieval practice translate into classroom practice?](https://impact.chartered.college/article/does-research-retrieval-practice-translate-classroom-practice/) Robert Coe 2020
    * yes and no ...
    * Why might retrieval practice fail?
        * Retrieval questions might be generated that focus solely on factual recall (these questions are easier to generate) rather than requiring higher-order thinking
        * Questions might be too easy and boost confidence without providing real challenge, which is likely to be a key ingredient for generating the kind of learning hoped for
        * Too much time could be allocated to the quizzes, effectively losing the time that students need to cover new material.
    * Just quizzing may not be enough
