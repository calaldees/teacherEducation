    * Morning everyone. I am looking for recommendations of 5-6 students who might be interested in the following (names on here is fine): 
    * Would any of our students (preferably PGCE but including TESOL/CELTA/MA Education students) be interested in joining an informal session at Chaucer College to chat with their students who are themselves training to be teachers?
    * Essentially, the students at Chaucer are:
        - all from Japan
        - training to be teachers (Primary and Secondary)
        - in the UK for a month (this includes going into school placements in Kent)
        - proficient in terms of English levels
        - possibly wishing to teach in the UK in future
    * Chaucer would like to host an informal session with refreshments…a chance for our students (and staff?) to mingle with theirs and chat about different professional experiences.
    * Date:
        * Monday 19th or Tuesday 20th – 4pm – 6pm.
