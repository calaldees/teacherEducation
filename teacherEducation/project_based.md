    * Agency: 
        * For your learners, there’s a massive difference between being asked whether they know the answer to a problem, and being asked to find a solution to one. 
        * The first question assumes knowledge (and thereby frames a lack of knowledge as failure) and has a narrow focus, while the second gives learners the room to be wrong or not know yet, and to develop real understanding and practical skills in a self-directed way.
    * Engagement: 
        * Learners with more agency are likely to be more engaged in their learning, too. 
        * A huge benefit of project-based learning is the scope it gives you to set relevant, real-world problems for your students.
        * Being able to relate their learning to their own lives motivates students: when they see that they can apply new skills and knowledge to other situations in their lives, they understand the true purpose of the work they’re doing.
    * Universal skills: 
        * Project-based learning doesn’t give students ready answers to a specific problem; it asks them to build a mental toolkit for understanding any problem, so that they can create solutions from the ground up. 
        * By enabling this in-depth learning, you equip your students for real life, letting them practise skills required in most industries today: taking initiative, working responsibly, decomposing and solving problems, collaborating in teams, and communicating their ideas clearly.
    * Links to python sheets - how to use each sensor - but not 'how' to combine them
    * (Points from me)
        * Need a experience programming already - loops, if statements, use of GUI, linux, setup Pi
        * Getting the hardware out each lesson is time-consuming, before putting them away again. 1 hour per lesson
        * Everyone needs the hardware. What if the hardware needs debugging?

    * Abstract
        * > There has been a growing interest in software engineering (SE) education to prepare K-12 students for the workforce. 
        > Despite the relevance of SE education for K-12 students, most of the available instructional units lack detail and are limited for large-scale use [27]. 
        > Previous research has also indicated that educators fear that SE concepts are too complicated for secondary students [14] 
        > ... Gutierrez et al . confirmed that primary and secondary students are more than capable of comprehending SE concepts [13].
    * > We use a block-based learning environment that connects to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which, in turn, provide students with a wide range of online datasets to use in their projects.

    * Create (performance task)
        * develop a computer program of their choice 
            * Submit program code 
            * video of programm running - text is fine - no voice narration
        * The Create performance task requires at least 9 hours of dedicated class time for students to complete. The end-of-course exam is 3 hours long and includes 70 multiple-choice questions and 4 written response prompts related to their Create performance task.

My thoughts
-----------


* Pallete of skill (concept)
* Can only be creative with a pallete


### Escape room idea

* [[creativity]]

Disclaimer.
We are time bound.
You may only have 1 hour of KS3 a week. 
To do a project like this you may need a significant investment in time. 
This may be too much for your current SOW and KS3 program. 
This is a _possible concept_ it is not a fully formed or trailed idea.


* Demo the concept of an escape room.
    * Show videos? Bring in equipment? Bring in a guest speaker? Enthuse them.
* Explore the sensors
    * Structured time to use the sensors - suggest a structured activity on the VLE for each one
        * See the Pi helpsheets at
            * [Project-based learning: A path to agency](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/articles/hw12-project-based-learning) 2020
        * Maybe split into pairs? try a sensor each and report back?
* Introduce project
    * Individually or in pairs
        * Design and create the code for an escape room puzzle that uses a microbit
            * When a code is entered - unlock a box
            * When a door is opened trigger something
            * Might be a scrambled message on paper that if they match the symbols on paper to the microbit they can decode the message
            * (The goal is not to actually build it thematically visibly, you may create the electronics physically)
        * Consider partnering with 2 other groups to create a theme
            * Haunted house
            * Derelict spaceship
            * Egyptian tomb
    * Assessment criteria
        * Be clear your assessment is of _use of Computing skills_ rather than artwork created to go with the puzzle
        * use of external input
            * buttons sensor
            * relay/magnet
        * use of external output
            * speaker
            * motor
            * magnetic latch
            * led
        * use of radio communication
            * describe the protocol
            * Transmission? Error handling? Ack?
        * use of a loop
        * use of storage
            * array?
        * use blocks
        * use code
            * code only features
        * collaboration with other teams - protocol design? hardware integration with others
        * marks for puzzle concept
    * Support materials
        * The Microbit simulator provides an accessible development environment before reaching for the hardware
        * List of basic project suggestions
            * Some weaker students will not no where to start. Give them a choice of three possible achievable simple projects
                * Cycle led's through a pattern. The puzzle is to press the button when the LED's are in a particular arrangement. The arrangement could be found by decoding a message on paper.
        * Setup a class wiki for the project
        * Some links to some more advanced tools
            * Links to Youtube videos? other tutorials/resources? on how to use a depth-sensor?
        * Record a video of you creating a starting project that demos the core skills (could be done live in class and recorded)
    * Assessment could be
        * Video of a them describing to other/students how it works
        * A poster describing how it works
        * Annotated code with comments mapped to assessment criteria
        * Each student can be accountable for a different part of the overall escape room project - it's important that students have individual accountability
    * Demo at open evening?
