    * Abstract
        * > There has been a growing interest in software engineering (SE) education to prepare K-12 students for the workforce. 
        > Despite the relevance of SE education for K-12 students, most of the available instructional units lack detail and are limited for large-scale use [27]. 
        > Previous research has also indicated that educators fear that SE concepts are too complicated for secondary students [14] 
        > ... Gutierrez et al . confirmed that primary and secondary students are more than capable of comprehending SE concepts [13].
    * > We use a block-based learning environment that connects to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which, in turn, provide students with a wide range of online datasets to use in their projects. 
    * > Human-Computer Interaction, Prototyping,
    * > virtual week-long summer camp
    * "Computer Science Frontiers" as a follow up to "AP Computer Science Principles" (see below)
    * Create (performance task)
        * develop a computer program of their choice 
            * Submit program code 
            * video of programm running - text is fine - no voice narration
        * The Create performance task requires at least 9 hours of dedicated class time for students to complete. The end-of-course exam is 3 hours long and includes 70 multiple-choice questions and 4 written response prompts related to their Create performance task. 
            * Indentify inputs/outputs, funcitons, reational operators
