The list
========

What should be happening in most lessons
----------------------------------------

* Students should be doing
    * What active tasks will they be doing? (plan from what you what them to be doing, then design your part)
    * don't talk for more than 15min cumulative in a lesson (maybe even less)
* Where possible, communication should be non verbal - reduce your volume footprint
    * #7/d-Behaviour-LearnHow-non_verbal 
    * #7/e-Behaviour-LearnHow-least_intrusive_intervention
* When asking a question to the class, (in most cases) everyone should actively respond (All student response systems)
* Check students understanding before transitioning to a task 
    * #7/e-Behaviour-LearnHow-check_understanding_instruction 
    * #7/i-Behaviour-LearnHow-routines_transitions
* Pupils should be able to measure/gauge their/other progress (aware of criteria)
* Equity of interaction/support
    * did you spend too long with a particular group of students?
    * (has everybody in the room has grown)
* Absent last lesson identified and given guidance
* Know 'why' they are undertaking task
    * Wider context, carers
    * #3/8-SubjCur-LearnThat-discipline_transfer_context
    * #7/o-Behaviour-LearnHow-careers_long_term_pastoral
    * #8/m-Wider-LearnHow-careers_long_term_pastoral career (Part of Computing Quality Framework) 
* When teachers ask questions - you must be able to justify the _intent_ of the question
    * What did you use the data you collected for? why did you collect it? (extend or review - constantly - not a linear process (a contingent one) - "I don't know what to do next until I find out what sense my students made of that") responsive teaching
* Make students less dependent on teachers (us)
    * long term and short term (make yourself obsolete)
* #6/j-Assessment-LearnHow-feedback_actionable
* Justify your pedagogical choices
    * (Why group work? Why scaffold in this way? why choose assessment mechanism)
* Can justify/evidence what adaptions you have made for which students and why
* Explicit literacy Literacy/terminology


Lesson Plan (Simplified list)
-----------
* Previous lesson student notes 
    * (Initials of who achieved? Who didn't achieve? who was absent? - have a plan for them)
* Explicitly call out adaptions (not teach to the middle)
    * There is an entire column for this
* Planned students active on tasks (they are doing)
    * Reduce your talk
* Plan strategy for "how do you know they have made progress?"
    * Record your assessment (initials of students?)
    * When are you going to do this?
* Explicit Keywords/Terminology/Literacy
* Include meta 'why' you've structured it this way and 'context' (even if it's brief)
