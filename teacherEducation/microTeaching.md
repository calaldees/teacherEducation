Microteaching
=============

* [Microteaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microteaching)
    * > used in teachers’ pre-service education to train them systematically by allowing them to experiment main teacher behaviors
    * > reciprocal negotiation of the students actively presenting and watching about the performances can make great contribution to the acquisition of the skills (Taşdemir, 2006)
    * > Video recordings provide pre-service teachers with the chance of evaluating themselves by engaging them in more experiences and configurations (Jensen et al., 1994)


Task
----

* You are to plan and deliver 15 min computing lesson to the PGCE group as if we were KS3 or KS4 students
* The lesson can be any topic of computing in KS3 or KS4
* We will then discuss/comment on the lesson (10min)
    * Suggestion: Video the segment and comment on the video together
        * Research suggest this allows for a deeper reflection

Direction for the task/topic was deliberately light to facilitate
* The selection of a strong/comfortable topic
* The freedom to choose allocation of time, trial ideas, trial technologies


Spirit of the exercise
----------------------

* An open exploitative experiment
    * We are not looking for polished lessons or skills
    * This may be the first time any of you have delivered a lesson
    * It is a REALLY scary experience
* Observations 
    * are normal practice throughout your carrier
    * Members of my teaching department may join our sessions in future to observe my practice
    * This ongoing transparency is normal and is done to help everyone grow
        * For your own piece of mind and sanity, try to embrace this concept whole heartedly
* Recordings for reflection
    * It's hard to reflect/capture/examine 'on the fly'. Recordings help us reflect and take a step back
    * No recordings will kept beyond the end of the session. It is a tool to facility the session feedback only
        * If recording are to be kept longer - an ethics form will need to be completed
    * I review and reflect on recordings of my own sessions sometimes
* The future?
    * Research suite for recording lessons (cool concept)


Random order
------------

```python
import random
names = ['bob', 'jane', 'sally']
print(names.pop(random.randrange(len(names))))
```
