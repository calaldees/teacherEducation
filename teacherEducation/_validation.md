Module Aims
This module engages the student in the critical evaluation of theoretical ideas
and recent research findings including international studies that are pertinent
to their subject specialism. It offers students the opportunity to study, critique
and evaluate in depth and with rigour, a curricular area or approach that is of
importance to them and which is beneficial to the professional community
and will further promote the sense of a teaching collective. At the heart of
this Module is the conviction in the individual learning journey which the
student undergoes, thereby extending the knowledge and understanding in
their chosen subject specialism in the secondary age phase to include both a
deeper and wider range of educational principles, practices and applications.
Learning Outcomes at Level 7
By the end of this module students should be able to demonstrate, in relation
to their chosen subject specialism, their:
1. Ability to utilise and critique informed research and critical reflection to
systematically appropriate aspects of pedagogy into their professional
practice promoting curiosity, enjoyment of learning and a positive
impact on learners;
2. Systematic, clear rationale showing a comprehensive understanding of
its effectiveness for teaching their chosen subject, and which takes
account of current or relevant educational theory including
international contexts in relation to their subject;
3. Active critical engagement, participation and autonomy in learning and
strong reflective capabilities to ensure further development of their
own subject pedagogy, practice and professionalism.

Learning Outcomes at Level 6
By the end of this module students should be able to demonstrate, in relation
to their chosen subject specialism, their
1. Systematic professional understanding and conceptual knowledge of a
range of aspects of pedagogy, the ability to apply this to their
professional practice and to justify their choice;
2. Systematic and conceptual understanding of effective strategies
available to promote learning and the ability to evaluate their impact;
3. Engagement and participation in learning and the ability to reflect to
ensure further development of their own subject pedagogy, practice
and professionalism;

## Indicative Module Content
Student teachers will examine and develop their educational values and
philosophies of education that underpin areas specific to their subject.

This module encourages student teachers to ask critical questions of current pedagogy, policy and practice in their subject to enhance their understanding of historical and current issues that shape the nature of their specific subject in the education sector/s and the impact it has on their learners.

There will be a particular focus on student teachers developing a systematic understanding of the relationship between their subject, the current curriculum, the practices of teachers and pedagogic research which best ensures their specific subject teaching is creative, innovative and inclusive.

Subjects within Subject Pedagogy in the PGCE Secondary include: Art and
Design, Biology, Business, Chemistry, Citizenship Computing, English,
Geography, Health and Social Care, History, Mathematics, Modern Foreign
Languages, Music, Physics, Psychology, Physical Education and Religious
Education.

## Learning and Teaching Strategies
The learning and teaching strategies employed in Subject Pedagogy(Secondary) use a wide variety of techniques to develop the student teachers’ knowledge, understanding and skills to meet their subject specific intended learning outcomes and towards meeting the overall programme intended learning outcomes and the national standards.

This will be achieved through, but not limited to, their attendance and participation in seminars and discussions, peer presentations, study visits locally, nationally and internationally, discussions with curriculum mentors, researching, writing and presenting focus specific assignments, attendance and participation in school-based CPD activities and training events.

Students will be engaged in a range of activities both as individuals and in small groups and will receive tutor and peer feedback on, but not limited to, micro teaching, demonstrations, critical reflections and presentations that employ a range of media, methods, techniques, processes and materials.

Students teachers will develop their own specialist subject knowledge and understanding through, but not limited to, engaging with practical tasks and study which have been highlighted through tutor and peer feedback and self-evaluation, activities undertaken during Professional Placements.

Subject Pedagogy makes use of research and materials highlighted through
subject associations, historical and current government, curriculum and
examination guidelines and statutory requirements.

## Indicative Assessment
Students complete a practical submission linking theory and application using
evidence from a chosen specific area in their professional practice to
demonstrate critical understanding of, and progression in, how children and
young people learn in and through their chosen subject and pertinent to their
specific age range. This submission is made through an individual presentation
to an audience (50% weighting) supported by a 2,000 word essay (50%
weighting) which is a written rationale of the research and educational
principles which have shaped their conclusions to their presentation.
