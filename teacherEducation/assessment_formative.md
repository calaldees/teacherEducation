Formative assessment is more effective then steaming/setting

* [Inside the Black Box](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003172171009200119) (Black and Wiliam, 1998) [alternate](https://weaeducation.typepad.co.uk/files/blackbox.pdf)
    * Present policy treats the classroom like a _black box_ and offers no help with as to how to raise attainment. Inputs are money, teachers, resources. Outputs are grades. Whats happens inside the black box?
    * > Feedback to any pupil should be about the particular qualities of his or her work, with advice on what he or she can do to improve, and should avoid comparisons with other pupils
    * > For formative assessment to be productive, pupils should be trained in self-assessment so that they can understand the main purposes of their learning and thereby grasp what they need to do to achieve
    * > Opportunities for pupils to express their understanding should be designed into any piece of teaching, for this will initiate the interaction whereby formative assessment aids learning
    * > The dialogue between pupils and a teacher should be thoughtful, reflective, focused to evoke and explore understanding, and conducted so that all pupils have an opportunity to think and to express their ideas
    * > Tests and homework exercises can be an invaluable guide to learning, but the exercises must be clear and relevant to learning aims. The feedback on them should give each pupil guidance on how to improve, and each must be given opportunity and help to work at the improvement

        * > The big mistake that Paul and I made was calling this stuff “assessment”… because when you use the word assessment, people think about tests and exams’ (Stewart, 2012). He later commented that it should probably have been called something like ‘responsive teaching’ (Wiliam, 2013b).

    * Research suggests consistent effects
    * "Assessment of learning" helps teacher - not learner
    * "Assessment for Learning" focusing on the intention rather than the action - assessment becomes formative WHEN it is actually used to adapt teaching to the learners needs.
        * #6/l-Assessment-LearnHow-marking_only_for_improving_pupils
    * "Assessment for learning" strategy by the government is all about recording and reporting achievement - if the impact is not with the student then it's not having an effect
    * > Formative assessment == Such assessment becomes formative  when the evidence is actually used to adapt the teaching work to meet the learning needs (Black 2002)
    * Short term - In the moment - impact before they leave the classroom
    * > Changing what teaching think doesn't benefit students until it changes what teachers do
      > ... we've been trying to get teachers to think there way into a new way of acting. We need teachers to act their way into a new way of thinking
    * Aspects of formative assessment

|       | Where is the learner going | Where the learner is | How to get there |
|-------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Teacher | Clarify and share learning intentions | Engineering effective discussions, tasks, and activities that elicit evidence of learning | providing feedback that moves learners forward |
| Peer | Understand and share the learning intentions | Activating students are learning resources for one another |
| Learner | Understand the learning intentions | Activating students as owners of their own learning |

    * Activating students as owners of their own learning
        * Self assessment
        * Meta cognition
        * Emotional response (resilience to difficulties/failure)
        * Self efficacy
    * Activating students are learning resources for one another
        * Peer assessment
        * Peer tutoring
        * Mentoring
    * Providing feedback that moves learners forward
        * #6/l-Assessment-LearnHow-marking_only_for_improving_pupils
        * often the view from the rear view mirror - what was wrong with the last assignment - but they are never going to do that assignment again
        * Feedback should take out of the last assignment, what they need for the next assignment
    * How often should we do formative assessment - not more than once per minuet

    * If you don't think you can get better you will reject feedback
    * Create a culture where teachers want to improve - not because they are not good enough
    * Schools are talent refinery's - some kid get it, some kid don't - the good are sifted to the top.
    * Talent incubators or talent factories
    * https://youtu.be/zwGaG1b_T2w?t=172
    * Because it _is_ the case - does not mean it _ort_ to be the case
    * If you get a bell curve - you are not doing your job. A bell curve is what nature gives us
    * German school extended the school day - it widened the achievement gap - only the good students to access the additional content
    * IQ is 80% of GCSE grade - IQ inhabitability 60%
    * I don't want to live in a world where taller people are better at basketball
    * https://youtu.be/zwGaG1b_T2w?si=tlkPX5FlEPF9p8o5&t=300
    * I no longer believe in "equality of opportunity" - because that means the bell curve all over again. We need to give more help to the kids that need it
    * Send all the clever kids home on Thursday/Friday - that will close the achievement gap
    * Lower achieving pupils need a better chance of a good life
    * Consider control/impact matrix
        * some things are outside of your control and have high impact - _poverty_
    * Set's don't seem to impact on achievement - it's not an argument about data, the data is clear - it's about what middle class parents want
    * Some teachers are better than other teacher - so we drive teacher accountability - let's grade teachers - most people cant identify good teachers
    * More struggle more learning - less struggle less learning
    * 7 teachers
        * 3 have performed 0.5 standard deviations above consistently for 3 years
        * 4 have performed 0.5 standard deviations below consistently for 3 years
        * People shown video clips and asked to say good/bad teacher
        * nobody could tell (Strong 2011) - a coinflip was better odds - school principles, mentors, students, parents
    * You need 11 years worth of data to get an estimate predictor of how good a teacher is
    * We have better things to do with our time. There is no upside to grading teachers. Let's stop. Let's just help every teacher get better
    * How can you improve teachers if you cant measure them
    * Pareto 80:20 rule
        * Don't raise money for tax's until you can be sure you are doing the best you can with your current money
        * If have to take away from one thing to add to another - that's a political decision
        * If you can add to something without taking away from another - that's a technical matter and you should do it straight away
        * Can we improve education without adding more money?
        * If anything that you add damages what you have - then you are pareto optimal and only more money will improve it
    * Research will never tell you _what_ to do - it tells you what currently is
        * don't work
            * Smarter teachers
            * paying teachers more
            * learning styles
            * brain gym
        * Might work
            * differentiated instruction
            * grit (only for westpoint graduates)
            * growth mindset (impact on student achievement is not significant - never been validated)
            * social and emotional aspects of teaching
        * work a bit
            * firing bad teachers
            * charter schools
            * class size reduction
        * work a lot
            * curriculum improvement
            * formative assessment
    * Everything was hard before it was easy - remind children how hard it was to tie their shoe laces
    * Expertise is 
        * Specific and limited
        * Weakly related to general ability
        * Not reproducible to propositional knowledge - cant be reduced to words
        * Involves perception fo meaningful patters
    * Most teachers could be as good as the very best teachers within 10 years
    * You could have the very best school - it will just take you 10 years
    * In a collaborative environment teachers reach average of 1.0 in 3 years, in an average school this take teachers 7 years
    * Takeuchi 1995 - companies that manage tacit knowledge well - socialisation of staff
    * You get given advice - you sort of do it but don't really understand it until you were doing it yourself
* [Q&A with Dylan Wiliam at Embedding Formative Assessment SSAT/EEF Celebration Event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPTZpLaJvUA) 2017 1h15min
    * Schools are hyper optimised - everything you do is valuable - so improving education is hard - you can only improve it by stopping people doing good things so that they can do better things - teachers resist change because the things they are doing are good and needed - it's not laziness that _not everything gets marked_
    * SLT should not be advising in breakout groups - they are too detached - they change the dynamic, they are not the ground workers
        * Theory X - people are lazy and leaders need to monitor
        * Theory Y - people are ok and just need support
        * Better to start the conversation with Theory Y - turns out just asking most people to do their best is a pretty good strategy
        * If the metric is just make sales - that's easy - sell everything at a loss and boost sales ... but that's not what we want, we actually want is profit. 
        * We need corporate alignment. Cascaded objectives (OKRs based on OKRs) - direct reports had objectives that are aligned with theirs. 
        * Everybody made/succeeded in their objectives but the organisation did not get better/more-efficient
            * You MUST fail some of your objectives, otherwise they are not challenging enough.
        * there are no _experts_ in the group - equality of communication
    * A good teacher on their first day will be better than an average teacher after 20 years in the classroom
        * right now teachers are born, because we are not very good at making them
        * High IQ chess players improve in first few years but hit wall of experience. Sometimes the only way to progress is experience
        * Aim to reduce the variation in teacher quality
    * Effective & scaleable teacher professional development
        * better teachers are better, but it's impractical and expensive to replace the whole teacher workforce.
        * It's clear you have to invest in the teachers you've got
    * Formative assessment independent of any curriculum
    * Formative assessment is needed because children do not learn what we teach
    * The most important factor is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly.
    * "You should know this you're in year 5" ... how do you get into year 5 ... be in year 4 and have a birthday
    * High priest of the spreadsheet - worship it and it would predict
    * Formative assessment is very subject specific
    * Don't ever take in input from one volunteer - at minimum get them to discuss. Every person is active
    * Hold hand up and wait for silence
    * ask everyone to vote with fingers 1,2,3,4,5
    * responsiveness
    * Factors with most difference - 1. high socioeconomic status 2. teacher responsive instruction (formative assessment)
    * Least difference - exploration learner (because teachers probably do it badly). absence.
    * 'Area of Tapesium' 43:00 - introduce one method + formula - then in groups find all other ways
        * https://youtu.be/aPTZpLaJvUA?t=2580
        * couple be useful in computing (how many ways of doing this)
            * one of these methods uses while loops - or uses a stack
        * teacher can 'ramp up' difficulty by prompts during the activity
    * Good teaching looks like - Big question - student discussion - teacher lead - students consolidating
        * setting doesn't work - we get 50% of kid in the right set
    * Lesson Study 50:00 - no guarantee this will help
    * Genuine Peer observation of lessons - no SLT - nothing formerly recorded - teacher request - genuinely formative 52:00
        * Skip the formal assessment, just get to 'things that matter'
    * Don't solve problems that there is no guarantee these will improve learning
        * 4 domains of practice - 2 domains don't matter
        * Teachers can get better at stuff that doesn't matter
    * Stop talking about comment only marking - all engagement and response is more important
    * only 3% can get the top grade (? not overly useful for universities or anyone)
    * Growth mindset is good for saying "you will be more able in this area if you put in effort" - higher achievement not higher intelligence
    * 01:12:20 "You have to have slack to do formative assessment"
    * The thinking capacity of novices and experts is the same. Experts can draw on long term memory

Using evidence of achievement to adapt what happens in classrooms to meet learner needs

Students will resist formative assessment strategies
> Why am I doing your marking?

Teachers time is 100% full. There is nothing that teachers do that is 'not useful'. To make progress we need to prove that doing X is more effective than doing Y. You need to replace something with something more effective. https://youtu.be/7ynsMwzsCsg?t=2840

* [Developing the theory of formative assessment](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/9119063/Black2009_Developing_the_theory_of_formative_assessment.pdf) 2009 Dylan Wiliam, Paul Black
    * (Reasonably heavy reading - My Notes)
    * Aims
        1. provide a unifying basis for the diverse practices which are said to be formative.
        2. to locate formative interactions within more comprehensive theories of pedagogy.
        3. linking our analysis to other theoretical writing about learning interactions
        4.  suggests ways to extend and/or improve those practices.
        5.  offer suggestion about such (future) enquiries.
    * How these were connected not previously articulated
        * Sharing success criteria with learners
        * Classroom questioning
        * Comment-only marking
        * Peer- and self-assessment
        * Formative use of summative tests
    * requirements
        * Establishing where the learners are in their learning
        * Establishing where they are going
        * Establishing what needs to be done to get them there
    * "Almost" and "Nearly" are the norm in most classrooms, as teacher tries to move to "The Correct Response"
        * What the learner actually hears and interprets is necessarily what the student intended to convey.
    * Student distracted, board, other conflicting goal other than growth goals;
    * > A search for well-being implies that students are more concerned with maintaining or restoring positive feelings than with the pursuit of growth goals.
    * Pulled off the _growth track_ and onto the _well-being_ track
    * the teacher’s problem: on receipt of a response, she has to decide how the student came to make it
        * inadequate growth strategy
            * such as working with a mis-conception, 
        * or using a well-being strategy
        * Misunderstood question or language, mislead by aspect of question
        * Not understood quality criteria of required answer
        * all questions only have one answer?
        * Using an answer that was correct but outside the teachers identification
    * Point out perceived flaw or open exploratory discussion to find reasoning behind answer
    * Vygotskys work centers around
        * development == requires changes in the psychological functions available to the learner, 
        * learning == the acquisition of new mental capabilities, without changes in the available psychological functions
    * creating cognitive conflict rather than giving answers 
        * the importance of dialogue to serve the social construction of knowledge, and to meta-cognition involving learners’ reflection on their own learning, makes it clear that formative assessment practices are an essential feature
    * "Big Question" Universal pedagogy - present proposals - teaching brings it all together
    * > teachers often behave as if they believed that they could do the learning for the learner, with disastrous consequences
    * Categories of feedback
        * (high effective) information about task and how to perform it more effectively (low) target settings, (lower) praise/punishment
        * (effective) when learners confidence in feedbacks production is high
        * task level feedback
        * process level feedback (advice-organiser)
        * self regulation feedback
