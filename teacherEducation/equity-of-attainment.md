Equity of Attainment
--------------------

* TASK: 
    * Write down in your own words definitions of the following terms (6min)
    * Compare them with a peer (3min)
    * (are you aligned?)

* Define
    * Equality
    * Equity
* Difference between
    * Diversity and Inclusion?
    * Equality and Equity?

* Equality
    * > the state of being equal, especially in status, rights, or opportunities.
* Equity
    * > education equity is based on the premise that an individual's level of education directly correlates to future quality of life. Therefore, an academic system that practices educational equity is a strong foundation of a society that is fair and thriving
* Equality vs Equity
    * > Equality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities. Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.

### Criticality

Ongoing debate about equity in education. Juxtaposed sides arguing passionately.

* Discovery Institute (USA) Opinion piece - [‘Equity’ in Education: Equal Opportunity or Equal Outcome?](https://www.discovery.org/education/2021/07/28/equity-in-education-equal-opportunity-or-equal-outcome/)
    * > Rather than equality of opportunity, equity would mandate equality of outcome. This goal is not only un-American — it is impossible to attain

* [Dylan Wiliam Embedding Formative Assessment SSAT/EEF celebration event keynote](https://youtu.be/zwGaG1b_T2w?t=172)
    * > If you get the bell curve in your school, I would suggest that you are not doing your job, because the bell curve is what nature gives us, the bell curve is what happens when we treat every single kid the same
    * > I don't want to live in a world where taller people are better at basketball, but that's the reality we live in
    * lower achieving students (literacy/numeracy) have worse lives - can't participate properly in society - we should address that


Exploring the Extremes
----------------------

Education for all is seen as a human right

* Equality of support: Give equal time to all
    * Extreme 1: Give all student the same amount of time and input (which means that you get the bell curve)
    * Progress is a cumulative effect (the good just get better and weak just sink further)
* Equity of attainment
    * Extreme 2: Give support to weaker students to ensure all students achieve the same (eradicate/minimise the bell curve)
    * Actively fight the bell curve
        * Send all achieving students home (ignore the high achieving)
    * What's the metric?
        * Old strategy - ignore the gcse students level >= 4
        * Newer strategy - same, but for progress 8
            * Is it fare to let some children achieve the minimum (a "level2" at GCSE and meet their progress8) and say "that's all they will ever be". And then berate a high attaining student to do more work to cement their "level8".
* Reality - aim for the average
    * Everyone makes progress (but this progress is less than optimal in all area)
        * Least damage to weak
        * Least damage to strong
        * Best average case
            * Weak never socially advance
                * as gap between weak and strong will never close
            * Strong are not exceptional
                * Countries economic output?
* Conundrum - stuck in the vortex of:
    1. Play the "numbers game" or not
        * Extreme 1.1: Every student should exceed their progress8 score
            * (For every student above the average - there has to be another student below the average. If you have a whole class exceeding progress8, somewhere in the country there is a class that have all fallen behind. There is no middle-ground on this - that is what an average is by definition.)
            * Just shift the bell curve to the right
        * Extreme 1.2: No attainment matters - It's all personal growth - everyone is an individual and we all progress differently
    2. Play the "who to help game" or not
        * Extreme 2.1: Just teach the bottom 50% and ignore the high achievers. 
            * High achievers will already have a good life, they don't need educating
        * Extreme 2.2: Focus on the top 50% - Measurable attainment matters - stuff needs to get done and some tasks are so skilled they need a lifetime of training to get there
            * The low achievers will never achieve anyway. We need skilled people to perform the high value work in society


TASK: (10min)
* > The bell curve is what nature gives us
* What do you want your personal attainment spread to look like
* Draw your class distribution bell curve
* Can you describe why?


Further Thoughts
----------------

* Personal attitude - should we care about the bell curve of attainment? Why are you even teaching?
