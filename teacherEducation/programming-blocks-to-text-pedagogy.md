Blocks to Text
==============

* Convert from block, text, flowchart, pseudo code and vice-versa
* Scratch -> python
    * Scratch is very visual
    * Blocks insulate from syntax, layout and compile errors
    * Scratch super easy to "parallelise" but mad difficult in python
* TODO: way more articles (TeachProgramming)
