Consider the Short, medium, long term actions for these students

> Alex is in year 11 and has moved to the school recently. They are currently transitioning gender and left their last school due to bullying. Alex's demeanour is anxious, shy, quiet and reserved. They are not social integrating well.

> Ahmed is in year 9 and is an elective mute. Based on their CAT/SAT's they are progressively underachieving each year. Ahmed is attentive and tries to engage with the work but does not participate in group or class discussions well.

> Janice has poor attendance (87%). Often defiant to instructions. Rarely attempts homework. Year 10.

> Amina is very short sighted. Year 8. She hates being singled out and made to sit at the front, she feels unconformable that everyone is looking at her. She always needs information repeated before she starts a task.

> Sina has english as a second language and always needs additional teacher support to start a task. They either complete programming assignments very well or fails to submit anything. Year 9.

> Brian (Year 7) can reason about tasks verbally, but types so slowly that he has been unable to complete 4 out of the 6 tasks in the space of the lesson this term. He has come back at lunchtime to finish his tasks.

> Add your own from your experience
