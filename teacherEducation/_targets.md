* > ... we've been trying to get teachers to think there way into a new way of acting. We need teachers to act their way into a new way of thinking <sub>Dylan Wiliam</sub>
* Unless the target changes what you do, there is no point in having it
* How is this change going to manifest in your teaching?
    * Not a "list of actions"
* Targets are cumulative they should lead to embedded practice
* Your target should describe what you are going to embed long term in your practice and how this will manifest 
    * What class are we likely to see this with?

> "We spend so much time trying to be changing the way teachers think to get them to change what they do. We need to change what they do to get them into a new way of thinking"

* Your mentor may need help formulating targets
* There is not absolute 'Right' and 'Wrong'


Target Task
-----------

* The targets below are all targets set to actual computing teachers last year.
* I have not selected these because they are 'good' or 'bad'. I have just taken a sample

TASK:
Have a look at some of the targets
Discuss 
* What is good about them - Why
* What is bad about them - Why



1. Identify good classroom principles, positives and what would I avoid - specific 
    * Mentor: Speak to student in mentor meeting 
    * Trainee: Observe other classes in other subjects during free periods and produce a short reflection on it. 
2. How can you make your Do Nows more engaging so all students can participate in them despite IT issues and are engaging with the content?
    * Mentor: Discuss formats of Do Nows that could be used whilst students are logging in to the computer and Google Classroom.
    * Trainee: Plan paper based Do Nows which students can complete whilst signing in to the computer and Google Classroom to avoid the Do Now running over time.
3. Plan assessments before lesson content is planned to give a clear goal to learning. 
    * Mentor: Discuss assessment methods which can be used to assess learning.
    * Trainee: Plan assessments for next term before lessons are planned. This will give topics a clear goal to plan to build knowledge and skills towards.  
4. Read Teaching Computing in Secondary Schools: a Practical handbook, chapters "designing a curriculum" and "medium term plan" and make notes of key points from reading, compare to department curriculum 
    * Mentor: Bring in resource for student teacher and look at comparisons made by student teacher and offer feedback 
    * Trainee: To read through stated sections and create a comparison on how school compares to the ones designed in the book. 
5. Use modelling to demonstrate the use of software
    * Mentor: Share link to pedagogy in computer science. Discuss practical methods e.g. follow or ‘do as I do’
    * Trainee: Meet with mentor to plan year 8 lesson. Use the link above to research how modelling can be used effectively in computing
6. Develop and understanding for machine learning and how this differs from traditional programming and the steps involved in training machines to perform tasks.
    * Mentor: Share lesson plan 5 and resources.  Share Ted talk and Tesla video.  Review the Google Teachable machine resource/website.  
    * Trainee: Review machine learning and AI. Construct meaningful PPT presentation  
7. Continue to develop year 9 understanding of programming concepts to feed into year 10 scheme of work, following a spiral curriculum model presented by the computing department.
8. Continue to develop knowledge surrounding advances excel skills for 8O. This is to ensure the confident teaching of the next series of lessons focusing on developing IF functions and nested IF functions.
    * Mentor: Continue to support with this subject knowledge development. 
    * Trainee: Be prepared for the graphs and charts lesson coming up in the next two weeks.

Model
"Questioning" - how do we improve this target?


Students should be aware (flip the script) - they were part of the discussions


* Menu of Targets (MoTa)


* Students should be clear about current expected behaviour. e.g. Listening, engaged in individual activity, engaged in focused pair discussion on topic, etc
    * Actions
        * 1. The teacher identify students that are not displaying expected behaviour 
        * 2. teacher performs intervention to correct the intended behaviour.
    * Lesson observations that identify that students are engaging with the specified activity.
    * There is a reduction in the amount of off-task/disruption time in lessons over a sequence of lessons (6-weeks/term)
* Ensure each Computing lesson explicitly promotes the national literacy strategy.
    * Each computing lesson should explicitly attempt to build vocabulary and promote some form of written communication.
    * Lesson plans should identify provision.
    * Student answers/work could be used to evidence student use/improvement in literacy/terminology/vocabulary/understanding over a period of 6 lessons (term?)
* Explicitly build routines that facilitate a smooth start to lessons
    * Weekly starter quiz tech xxx to review last lessons learning. Students access this automatically while register is being taken
* Every lesson plan should list the initials of student that were absent last lesson. There should be a plan/action/instruction/acknowledgement to these students.
