What is Computing
-----------------

TASK: Write down in your own words what the subject of 'Computing' is

* What is Computing?
    * Schizophrenic broad subject - practical skills (can they type?), hardcore compsci assessment of logic, eSaftey (how do you assess this?),  and social impact (essay questions)
* Computing
    * [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)
        * Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory)
        * Though more often considered an academic discipline, computer science is closely related to computer programming.
    * [Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Education](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360963237_Information_and_Communication_Technology_ICT_in_Education)
        * communicate, create, disseminate, store, and manage information
        * major role in work places, business, education and entertainment
        * exchanging information, teaching methods, learning approaches, access to scientific research and information communication technologies have led many to consider ICT as a catalyst for change
        * "Driving the car" analogy. Video editing, using spreadsheets to manipulate data, Use of email and other communication tools, creating wiki's.
    * [Futurelab handbook: Digital literacy across the curriculum](https://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/futl06/futl06.pdf)
        * Digital literacy is an important entitlement for all young people in an increasingly digital culture. 
        * It furnishes children and young people with the skills, knowledge and understanding that will help them to take a full and active part in social, cultural, economic, civic and intellectual life now and in the future.
        * To be digitally literate is to have access to a broad range of practices and cultural resources that you are able to apply to digital tools. 
        * It is the ability to make and share meaning in different modes and formats; to create, collaborate and communicate effectively and to understand how and when digital technologies can best be used to support these processes

Where is the AI in the National Curriculum? (20min)
---------------

Overflow (differ)

* TASK: Think Pair Share (10min)
    * Investigate [National curriculum in England: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study)
    * Where is the AI?

* Commentary (5min)
    * [NCCE Digital Skills Forum - AI and the Future of Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvtJdi8u7vU&t=218s) YouTube NCCE Simon Peyton Jones 2021 (One of the team that wrote the NC) 
        * (watch 3:38 to 6:ish)
        * Keep National Curriculum
        * Challenge _magic_
        * Shift of emphasis -> from _computation_ more to information and data
        * AI is another way to get the computer to do what you want - you give it data
        * Overfitting (exactly and only that cat) to precisely to one dataset. Eg.g a self driving car that can only drive to sainsburys

Introductions
-------------

### Who am I?

My background
* 7 years teaching ICT and Computing in secondary schools - Practical battle experience
* 10 years as a senior developer in central London across a range of domains
* (2 years sessions) + 2 year formally as Lecturer in Education. (You are my 5th cohort)
* I will be constantly upskilling this for the rest of my career

I have my own ideas about how to teach computing
* Multiple languages at once
* Freedom (self direct-ish)/project based/Creativity (removal of hierarchy)
* Unit tests, Pair programming (talking about code and collaborating), Version control
But this course is not about my _opinions_ or about my preferred teaching methods.
You must develop your own critically to develop your own subject pedagogy knowledge.

### Who are you?

TASK: 120 second summary
* Rough background (education, work)
* Course: PGCE, 7-14 or SchoolDirect?
* What are you exited about this year
* What are you fearful about this year (we are all vulnerable)

The burden of learning to teach - the _expert beginner_
Primary->Secondary->Uni->Career1Employment1->Career1Employment2->Retraining->Career2Employment1

### Quick Thumb-up-o-meter

* Multiple languages?
* Version control?
* Linux?

### You will outgrow my support

* Right now I might look to you like some super-human teaching deity.
* By the end of this course you will feel completely differently.
* I'm just some dude doing a job like you.
* By the end of this year you will have outgrown the support I can give you.
* At the celebration day at the end of the course we will just be a bunch of professionals sitting around and talking about education.
