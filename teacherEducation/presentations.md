Outstanding Presentations
=========================

* Understand what is required for the presentation assignment
* Consider pedagogies for "High Impact" experiences
* Consider practical presentation techniques



Task 1
------

* What is the purpose of your SP2 assignment?
* Think-Write-Pair-Share

<details>

* The WHY .. it's always the why .. why are we doing this
* If this does not impact on what you do in your teaching .. this is a huge failure

Tripp Critical Incident
-----------------------

Tripp says

1. Some phenomenon is observed and noted, which produces a description of what happened
2. Suggest explanation and meaning within the immediate context (make a diagnosis)
3. Find a more general meaning and classification/significance of incident (interpret the diagnosis)
4. Adopt a position as a result of _professional judgement_ that will result in a change in practice
    * Practical judgements which is the basis of every action taken in the conduct of teaching, and the majority of which is made instantly
    * Diagnostic judgements which involve using profession-specific knowledge and academic expertise to recognise, describe, understand and explain and interpret practical judgements
    * Reflective judgement which concerns more personal and moral judgements involving the identification, description, exploration and justification of the judgements made and values implicit and espoused in practical (teaching) decisions and their explanations
    * Critical judgements which, through formal investigation, involves challenge to and evaluation of the judgements and values revealed by reflection


Steps?
-----

1. Explore some incidents
    * One of mine ...
        * It's a ...
        * Student Withdrawing (this week) - my role
2. Create a critical incident (Typical to Critical)
    * A experience that made you think
    * Incidents happen, but _critical_ incidents are produced by the way we look at a situation: 
        * a critical incident in an interpretation of the significance of the event (Tripp , 2012, p.8)
3. Generate questions
    * Why did it matter to me that there were unexpected answers?
    * What did I do that provoked unexpected answers?
    * Is it important for learners that they hear unexpected answers?
    * Could I have done more to provoke more unexpected answers?
    * How could I make use of unexpected answers?
    * How could I plan for unexpected answers?
4. Find answers in the literature
    * [The Literature Review: Six Steps to Success - Second Edition](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/the-literature-review/book238875#contents) 2012 Lawrence A. Machi, Brenda T. McEvoy
    1. Select and Define a Topic
    2. Develop the Tools of Argumentation
    3. Search the Literature
    4. Survey the Literature
    5. Critique the Literature
    6. Write the Review
5. Reflect on answers with respect to your own practice
    * Bishopp and Trott’s (2015) Provoking Thinking Framework (PTF) gives a great theoretical justification that aligns with why I want to encourage unexpected answers, but is designed for early childhood learners. Can I adapt the framework for my context? 
    * I love Lucas et al’s (2016) conversation starters strategy, but it is designed to develop written responses. Would it work in an entirely oral setting?
6. Plan presentation
    * Script this
    * Be purposeful and economical - Every word counts!
7. Record presentation
    * See guides on blackboards for recording voice PPT's


Structured Dissection (Practical)
---------------------

* Passive watching/reading is NOT enough
* Dissecting by observation is a superpower - get good at 'reverse engineering' everything - see things other people don't

* Pedagogy aside ..
    * Pedagogy for "Videos", "Reading", "Trips/Fieldwork" - This applies to any autonomous engagement
    * Explicit "pre work" "preparation"

* Together - Commentary
* [Digital Media in Education: Critical Incidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UscN4dEdSp8)

* Time is important to visualise - 1 page A4 - temporal
* Identify
    1. Questions (Q)
    2. Diagnostic (Diag)
    3. Critique (Crit)
    4. External (colleague? literature?)


Explicit Reflective Models
--------------------------

You sound 'well posh' if you call out the models you're using - will take a few seconds

* [Becoming a Critically Reflective Teacher](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ed387073) Jossey-Bass Higher and Adult Education Series. Steven Brockfield. 1995
    * Brockfield 4 lenses model
        * Autobiographical lens
        * Learners lens
        * Colleague lens
        * Scholarship lens

Peer Assessment
===============

* How will your students know in detail the criteria they are being assessed on? What are they aiming for? ...
* Be clear + model + get them to do it

* See Chris's Computing Critical Incident 2022

* [Mark Grid](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_23714_1/outline/edit/document/_3981665_1?courseId=_23714_1&view=content)
    * Highlight the words

<details>

* Chris' presentation should be upload to BlackBoard - if not - it was original submitted to this bucket
    * [TurnItIn Submission Bucket SP2 2022-23](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_21030_1/outline/lti/launchFrame?toolHref=https:~2F~2Flearn.canterbury.ac.uk~2Fwebapps~2Fblackboard~2Fexecute~2Fblti~2FlaunchLink%3Fcourse_id%3D_21030_1%26content_id%3D_3630464_1%26from_ultra%3Dtrue)


* You used a range of appropriate references and resources to structure a mature dissection of your teaching.
* Your incident is clearly focused on subject specific pedagogy.
* You demonstrated you have deep insight into your own process.
* You have independently arrived at clear actions.
* Your visuals matched and complemented your commentary.
Targets:
* Your subject specific reading was limited. This was reflected in your mark for 'Reading' and was the major reason you did not reach the distinction category.

Congratulations on such a solid submission.

Broader Presentation Skills - Conveying a clear point
===========================

* [How to sound smart in your TEDx Talk | Will Stephen | TEDxNewYork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S0FDjFBj8o) 2015
* [TEDx Speaker Guide](https://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_speaker_guide.pdf)
    1. Start by making your audience care, using a relatable example or an intriguing idea.
    2. Explain your idea clearly and with conviction.
    3. Describe your evidence and how and why your idea could be implemented.
    4. End by addressing how your idea could affect your audience if they were to accept it.
    * Whatever structure you decide on, remember:
        1. The primary goal of your talk is to communicate an idea effectively, not to tell a story or to evoke emotions. These are tools, not an end in themselves.
        2. Your structure should be invisible to the audience. In other words, don’t talk about how you’re going to talk about your topic – just talk about it


Practice a new gesture explicitly
---------------------------------

* Task: Talk about nothing - mimicking my gestures as inspiration
* Identify/copy 2 gestures/pattern of mine - add one gesture pattern of yours


Additional presentations notes of mine
--------------------------------------

* Wingman/CoPilot concept for presenting
* Outlawed words
  1. "umm" or "errr"
    * Anecdotes: Told the CEO 213 ums + 42 ums = 255 ums
    * Strategy: Practice a talk to someone and ask them to bang the table every time you do this.
  2. "Basically", "Simply", "So", "Ok", "Just" ...
    * or any other superfluous word
    * Just and Simply and disheartening wheesle words
    * You are on a word budget. Ration your words!
    * "All you have to do", "Basically" or "Simply" should be banned. These trivialise a subject
    * Stop asking of things are "ok". If you need too, Deliberately request a response and pause sufficiently if needed to get this response.
    * Don't use vague words: "Things", "Stuff". Be specific
    * Try not to use "It" - fully qualify the subject
* Keep to time
  * It is better to have too little (focused) content than too much (waffle)
* Projection Tech
    * Raise font size (`ctrl`+`=`)
    * Learn how to use your laptop to output to projectors (quickly)
    * Have good Display connectivity in venues
      * Bring all the adaptors and cables you need (with sufficient length)
    * (Maybe screen share video?)
* Physical Space
  * Look where the lights are
* Hands should be free
  * Technique: Use your hands and stage position to tell a story
    * Interpretive dance
  * Strategy: Practice with and/or Learn to use a mic (if needed)
    * Practice in the physical environment you will present in
* Technique: Learn to project your voice
  * You can't speak normally. This is a different setting!
* Behaviour and crowd control
  * Don't start until you have everyone's attention
    * Stick to your guns
    * Stop talking when they loose focus - they will look back at you to find out why you've paused and they will probably find you silently making eye contact back at them. This shows you know and are aware.
  * To bring people back with no-verbal queues
    * Use eye contact
    * Hand gestures to bring people forward and refocus
    * If people are distracted (using their phone, or computer, or talking) - Have the courage to pause - wait for eye contact - nod or smile or raise -eyebrow - move on
