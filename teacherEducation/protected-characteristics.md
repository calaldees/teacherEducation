Situation Discussion
--------------------

Mental thinking - upfront now - when a situation does occur we have some grounding for how to act

### Situation 1 (15min)

* Real school situation
    * [Head Tracking for Desktop VR Displays using the WiiRemote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw)
    * I built the ir goggles + battery over the weekend and wanted to demo the technique
    * I started playing the video and one student remarked
        * > It's a chinky
    * What was the intension of the young person?
* TASK1: (Whole group consolidation) Think (2min) What actions could be taken? Why? (10min)


<details>

* Suggestion: 
    * Be prepared to drop all planned activities and focus on this more important topic
        * (Make a serious statement - Change the room layout? Turn all the computers off?)
    * Don't use aggression to convey your urgency. Use enquiry.
        * Remember: What does aggression and authority convey in our hidden curriculum?
        * The fact you have completely stopped the previous activity already conveys the gravity of the situation
    * Have a plan - just talking may not be enough - 
        * Decide on the goal - vocalise the goal - write it
        * Other prep
            * Could you have paper printed? power-point ready?
