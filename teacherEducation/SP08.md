* (PGCE) Prep for SP08 - ITAP Week "Inclusion"
    * Microteach: focussing on giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions which includes feedback to trainees (peer/tutor/both)
        * Deliver a 10 min teaching episode on "Cyber security threats" (if KS4? see AQA spec for more details. if KS3? Consider [[eSafety]] "Keeping children safe in education 2022")
    * In session we will:
        * Evaluate the ITAP and reflect on feedback to take forward to placement 1
            * (Written)

    * Experiences
    * Changes to your mental model? (your computing teaching)
* Review of ePortfolio
    * Lessons you Observed
    * Lesson packs to date
        * (split up solid paragraphs into points!)

Stumble Upon
------------

* [Joy.js](https://ncase.me/joy/)
    * a pedagogic tool?
    * cross curricular? could you approach a science, maths or music teachers? would they be interested?

Question: Showcase time in sessions?


Mental Models
-------------

* Factual errors
    * Simple atomic facts
* Broken models
    * Addressed with logic and reasoning
* Fundamental beliefs
    * No idea that computers could do that - or used like that - or had that impact

Questions: 
1. How do you help identify mental models?
2. How do you help develop mental models?

* Competent people have a mental model of how to approach a common/regular task (e.g. debugging code). Competent people have constructed a model of what to do 'in advance of the problem'.
    * e.g. removing an audience from a difficult student, dropping a lesson completely to tackle a racial or sexual slur.

<details>
<summary>Steps to take to fix a bug ...</summary>

* reproduce the bug
* perform a git bisect, or review recent PRs, if it seems to be a recent regression
* read the stacktrace
* inspect the state of the code with a debugger or print statements
* look at unit tests or PRs to learn the expected usage of particular modules
* ask for help from someone with more domain-specific expertise

Q: What mental models are you building as a teacher?
