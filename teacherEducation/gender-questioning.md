gender questioning
==================

* > I’m not the most trans-aware person on the planet but that reading seems laden with imprecise and judgemental language like “normal sexual function” and gendered assumptions like “boisterous behaviour”. 
  > Can you recommend any other readings with a more inclusive tone that may balance it out?
* > Thank you so much for your email – I was also challenged by the reading and even more so by the consultation document from the government that I read over the Winter break which purports to give advice to schools about ‘gender questioning children’. The document that is linked in the weekly mentor meeting journal seems to have heavily influenced the government’s thinking in this regard because there is a lot of similar terminology used across the two:
  > I’m pleased to report that there are indeed many readings which balance out the transphobic rhetoric and many of those are referenced in the book:

    * > Schools have been required to record all incidents of homophobic bullying since 2010. 
      > Anti-bullying policies should specifically include homophobic and transphobic bullying. 
      > Reasons for bullying can be a reflection of society’s prejudices. 
      > Punishing an act of bullying is a hollow exercise where there is no work done to address the ignorance and misinformation that underlies it.
