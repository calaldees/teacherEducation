### What are schools expected to deliver?

* [Improving literacy in secondary schools a shared responsibility](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413184/Improving_literacy_in_secondary_schools_-_report_summary.pdf) Ofsted 2013
    * > In the secondary schools where teachers in all subject departments had received training in teaching literacy and where staff had included an objective for literacy in all the lessons, senior managers noted an improvement in outcomes across all subjects, as well as in English.

### The Secret of Literacy

> Focussing on literacy objectives will not improve anything.
> Instead, what’s needed is for teachers to _explicitly teach the language of their subject_ alongside their subject content.
> My slightly surprising insight is that if this is done well, the fact that children’s reading and writing improves is almost trivial.
> What really matters is that students get better at thinking.
[The Secret of Literacy: making the implicit explicit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Literacy-Making-implicit-explicit/dp/1781351279/) - [David Didau](https://learningspy.co.uk/literacy/what-to-do-about-literacy/) 2014 978-1781351277


* We need literacy to in order to think
* Language shapes how we think
* To think like a computer scientist you have to talk like a computer scientist

What is the tipping point from _'just using words that scientists use'_ and _'talking like a scientist'_?

Categorising Vocabulary
* active/expressive vocabulary (words that are used autonomously)
* passive/receptive vocabulary (words that are understood and can be responded)
* unknown vocabulary

Figures (need to correlate exact source - these are from David Didau's book)
* Age 7 - top 25% have vocabulary of 7,100 words - bottom 25% 3,000 (parents?)
* Age 16 - 1 in 12 students has a working vocabulary of 800 words
* An average graduate has a vocabulary of 20,000 words

* [Matthew principle/effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) - accumulated advantage (e.g. rich get richer)
* The young people that have a larger vocabulary have an ongoing compound interest advantage

### Phonics

For Primary teachers this is "bread and butter".
Secondary teachers tend to suck at this. It's an important foundation.

* [How to Teach Phonics in Secondary Schools](https://lexonik.co.uk/insights/how-to-teach-phonics-in-secondary-schools)
    * > Schmitt et al. (2017) ... suggested that understanding 95-98% of the words used in a text is an acceptable threshold for reading comprehension. 
    * If a reader can't read the BOLD words
        * > The *abundance* and *distribution* of organisms in an ecosystem is determined by *biotic* and *abiotic* factors. Animals and plants have *adaptations* to allow them to compete for resources.​
        * What can they comprehend? ​
            * Something about organisms in an ecosystem are down to factors​.
            * There's competition for resources​.
    * 5 pillars of reading
        1. Phonemic Awareness​
            * the sounds
        2. Phonics Instruction​
            Linking sounds to letters
        3. Fluency Instruction​
            * speed, accuracy, expression
        4. Vocabulary Instruction​
            * Examination of component parts of words​
        5. Comprehension Instruction​
            * Independent, strategic, metacognitive readers


### Readability Score

A useful tool for planning

* SMOG Readability Score
    * https://charactercalculator.com/smog-readability/ 
    * The SMOG calculator isn't perfect but can be a useful aid when planning and resourcing lessons. 
    * Just copy and paste a sample of your text into the space provided and press 'calculate'. Underneath it will give you the SMOG score which is essentially the reading age, which you can compare to the students' recorded scores.
    * example - copy and paste [[__CCF-reading-summary]]

### Reading across the Curriculum

* [Five Ways To: Weave Reading into the Curriculum](https://teacherhead.com/2022/05/05/five-ways-to-weave-reading-into-the-curriculum/)
    * It’s uncontroversial – uncontested – that reading fluency is a key component in students’ wider learning capacity and confidence
    * it is actually possible for some students to go through a school day or week without doing very much reading at all
        * power-points and verbal explanations
        * read by others - the teacher or a series of student readers
        * reading only in the form of questions for writing tasks, rather than extended prose to be read and understood
    * (reading should be) a significant feature in the daily curriculum diet, not an add-on
        1. Present information via text rather than power-point 
        2. Buy textbooks or prepare workbooks with embedded reading activities
        3. accountable reading routines
            * many students can appear to be reading without actually doing it
            * they need to expect to have to do something meaningful with the content of the text to force them to make the mental effort
            * summarise? questions-after-reading? text-to-find-answers-to-questions
        4. getting students to read back a text that has been read to them
            * maybe pairs?
        5. Accountable reading for homework
            * students don’t read at home because they either don’t know what to read or there is no purpose
            * students will need to process the meaning in the text in order to complete a task
    * ![Five Ways to weave reading into the curriculum. David Goodwin](https://headguruteacher.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/five-ways-to-weave-reading-into-the-curriculum-01.png?w=724)


### Computing Specific Literacy Strategies

* [Scaffolded Reading In Computing](https://web.archive.org/web/20230603182703/https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/articles/hw20-scaffolded-reading-in-computing) 
    * HelloWorld Issue 20 [pdf](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/issues/20/pdf) pg70, Rachel Arthur
    * Example with reading a news article about Phishing and getting students to dissect it
    * Scaffolded Reading
        1. Pre-reading
            * What technical terms do we know
                * look for certain technical vocabulary?
            * explicitly describe the "Focus of the reading" (what are we looking for)
            * Has anyone you know been victim to a phishing attack?
            * Whole-class prediction?
        2. During reading
            * Pause, discuss vocabulary
            * Ask elaborative questions
        3. Post-reading
            * find key vocabulary in the text (don't stop drawing attention to vocab!) unpack and repack
            * write a response to the text
* "Practice with Poetry" (computing vocabulary) - Adrienne Tough
    * Hello World [issue 12](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/issues/12) Page 68
        * 3 activity ideas with starter and plenary

### Further points

* reading should not be used to teach new topics - too much cognitive load
    * use reading to improve vocabulary and knowledge of existing areas
* the activities that follow the reading are just as important as the reading itself
* depth of work knowledge and ability to make inferences
    * activities designed to decode words and understand language should require prior knowledge and understanding
* vocabulary should be revisited in different ways to cement it
    * collaborative learning. students should be given the opportunity to discuss vocabulary
* Bell Foundation [Great Idea: DARTs](https://www.bell-foundation.org.uk/eal-programme/guidance/effective-teaching-of-eal-learners/great-ideas/darts/) - directed activities relating to texts:
    * analyse or reconstruct
    * highlight words in different categories (e.g words they did not understand is a category)
    * match key words to their definitions
    * treasure hunt: find specific types of words and describe their purpose
    * fill in the blanks: -> then make their own fill in the blanks activity (improve vocab and sentence structure)
* read individually (with scaffold) then read again as class
* reading should be used to summarise previously learnt content
* vocabulary activities related to reading should have a specific purpose, encourage recall and challenge
* vocabulary development should be a mixture of independent and collaborative learning (individually for assessment)

### The _Language_ of Computer Science (20min)

#3/u-SubjCur-LearnHow-build_verbal_terminology

> Some words have specific meaning in the computer science community, but a slightly or sometimes completely different meaning in everyday discourse (e.g. nouns like code, memory, address, folder, loop, bug, value, or verb to save, to code, to retrieve, to submit)

TASK: In your groups - add rows to the following table (10min group) + (5min whole class)
(My hope is that the list you generate could a useful resource for your future teaching)

| Computing Term | Possible interpretation | Technical meaning |
|-|-|-|
| Hot Key | The colour key on a graph that is referring to temperature | todo? |
| Address | Where I live | todo? |
| Inspect a log | From a tree, maybe it has ants | Filter/inspect historical system activity for diagnosis of issues |
| Submit a request | Have to ask for something from someone in authority | A data request to an external/separate system |
| add more | _Expand this list_ | add more |

<details>

| term | possible |
|-|-|
| Python | A snake that is poisonous |
| Secondary Storage | My nans garage |
| Code review | A friend checking my secret message before I send it |
| I created a code | 
| Save | Money at the bank |
| Search | Like hide and seek |
| Library | 
| Jesus Saves | So I save my files too 
| Memory | How much you can remember
| Network | Friendship? - building nets?
| Windows | cant see though it
| Apple Mac | Keeps fruit dry
| Praommy on TV |
| Cloud | up therir
| Directory | Telephone or direction guide 
| Fishing emails | I dont want to eat thing
| Web| Spider web |

    * Metaphors can seed misconceptions
    * Metaphors: The data is transferred -> I will move the file to another folder
    * Computer is a living being: it fell asleep and woke up

### Computer Science Phrases (20min)

I want to explicitly incite you to explore/exercise your Computer Science terminology as part of this session.
e.g. give them two statements and ask them which one is technical and correct and why.

* Examples of real computer science language
    * _do, while_ is an iteration pattern
    * What is the performance of the algorithm (n, n2, nlogn etc...)
    * Are these intermediary variables required in order to perform this comparison?
    * Does the algorithm fit the logic space of the problem (i.e. if you're looking for largest prime numbers, do you need to loop through all numbers?)
    * Can you identify any side effects that might be caused by changing state within this method?
    * Old cartridge based games consoles did not have an operating system
* Examples of rubbish mumbo jumbo
    * I'm hacking the mainframe
    * Reroute the encryption key through a blockchain
    * Use a trans-half reduction to ensure the AI reaches peak performance
    * You can compute the bubble sort maxima with an algorithm
* If you want inspiration
    * [wikipedia List_of_algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms)

TASK: Can you create a list of Computing phrases. Some that are _real_ and some that are _fake_. You could possible use this as a fun starter with your groups. Can they identify the nonsense from the real computer talk. You can then follow up with the class what the real ones mean. This is explicit vocabulary exercise.
* Add to sahre-doc/whiteboard? (10min)
    * It may be worth you categorising some of these with a difficulty level (maybe KS3, KS4, KS5)?
* Present to whole group (5min)


### Exam Board phrases

* [Glossary of GCSE command words from AQA](https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/AQA-8525-CW.PDF)
    * The language of exams - can be explicitly taught
* [TES: Exam command words display Computer Science AQA GCSE](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/exam-command-words-display-computer-science-aqa-gcse-12581059)

> On my first job as a designer, I had no idea what my boss was asking me to do. Online, I had learned about “paper prototypes” and “iterating on mockups.” But here he was telling me to “sketch a wire” and “riff on that comp.” I felt like he was speaking another language.

#### Pop culture aside - StarTrek (as social commentary)

* Original StarTrek episode [Mirror, Mirror](http://www.chakoteya.net/StarTrek/39.htm) with a parallel universe evil enterprise. 
* A few of our original crew end up on the _evil enterprise_. They blended in by pretending to behave like assholes. 
* Meanwhile, the evil crew attempted to infiltrate the _good enterprise_ were immediately put in the brig.

### Banned Words/Phrases in the Computing classroom
* Easy to use
* User Friendly
    * These are meaningless and unqualified, don't let even KS3 students do this. We need to promote their ability to say why.
