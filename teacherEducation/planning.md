Planning
========

### Objectives

* What, and how, has teaching and learning of subject been affected in this area/my placement school?
* What are current subject practices?
* What are the skills of reasoning and problem solving in Computer Science and how are computing departments addressing these?
    * Anticipating common misconceptions; a tool to aid learning
* Planning for progression - Schemes of Work - Building schemata
    * Pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models
* Exploring strategies that aid teaching and learning including contextualised, independent, discovery

* Intro (15min)
* Comparing school approaches for progression (1 hour)
* Textbooks for teaching Computing? (45min)
* Practical Exploration (shape tools) (30min)
* Context and Relevancy (30min lecture)
Total 3 hours



Schemes of Work
---------------
Planning for progression - Building schemata

A scheme of work implements a syllabus.
* [Curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum) Wikipedia
    * > Curriculum is broadly defined as the totality of student experiences that occur in the educational process.
    * > The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student's experiences in terms of the educator's or school's instructional goals
* [Syllabus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabus) Wikipedia
    * A syllabus or specification is a document that communicates information about a specific academic course or class and defines expectations and responsibilities. It is generally an overview or summary of the curriculum.
* [Scheme of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_of_work) Wikipedia
    * > the structure and content of an academic course (syllabus). 
      > It splits an often-multi-year curriculum into deliverable units of work,
    * May include
        * Content
        * Objectives or Outcomes
        * Methods of delivery (student and teacher activity)
        * Assessment strategies
        * Resources

In KS3 - 3 Years is a long time - time to forget - revisit topics multiple times over a 3 year period. e.g. Most years have some kind of web work, network work, programming work, etc

Cognitive Load Theory (explored more next session _howStudentsLearn_)
> Working memory should be seen as short term and finite, 
> whereas long-term memory can be seen as infinite. 


### Comparing school approaches for progression (1 hour)

Reminder: 
* KS3 == Year 7 to Year 9 (Level 0 to 1)
* KS4 == Year 10 and Year 11 (Level 1 to 2)

Your familiar with [KS3 Computing National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3)

TASK 1: In pairs, compare the KS3 resources you have acquired from your school. (20min)

Make notes on + be prepared to present
1. How do the topics map to the National Curriculum? (is this specified?)
2. What are the links between topics for year 1, 2, 3?
    * What kind of progression are the creators thinking about?
3. What similarities/differences are there between the schemes of work?

(10min group confer)

TASK 2: Explore other KS3 SOW online (20min)
1. Other than the sequence of content, what other teaching resources are provided?
2. Would you be able to teach any of these units with the resources provided?

    * > buying, or using, someone else's scheme of work makes teachers less effective because they spend less time thinking about the curriculum as a whole, and that teachers and departments that create their own curriculum or scheme of work have more "impact".
