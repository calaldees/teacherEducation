Education Inspection Framework (EIF) (1 hour)
==============================




(copied from board and balanced)

* National Curriculum
    * > A high-quality computing eduction equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world
    * > Computing has deeps links with mathematics, science and design and technology, and provides insight into both natural and artificial systems.

### Historical Inspection
* [David Drown HMI](https://www.slideshare.net/Ofstednews/inspection-computing-and-e-safety-in-schools) 2014 (stepped down)
    * Teaching in computing is good or better when:
        * it is rooted in the development of pupils’ understanding of important concepts and progression within the lesson and over time; it enables pupils to make connections between individual topics and to see the *big picture*
        * teachers use a very wide range of innovative and imaginative resources and teaching strategies to stimulate pupils’ *active participation* in their learning and secure good or better progress across all aspects of the subject.
    * The computing curriculum is good or better when:
        * the contexts in which computing is taught are *relevant to pupils lives* and reflect the increasing use of computing in the world of industry
        * excellent links are forged with other agencies and the *wider community* to provide a wide range of enrichment activities to promote pupils’ learning and engagement with the subject
        * *links with other subjects in the school* are productive in strengthening pupils’ learning in computing
    * Leadership of computing is good or better when
        * there are effective strategies to delegate subject responsibilities where appropriate and to share good practice
        * computing has a very high profile in the life of the school
    * Finally ...
        * E-safety is now considered in the inspection of all education remits including the early years sector, further education and skills, and initial teacher education.

### (Current?) Computing Inspection
* [Ofsted: How to prepare for a computing Deep Dive](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/ofsted/) 2022 
    * Marc White, HMI Inspector for Ofsted and subject lead for computing
    * > The computing curriculum is really rich in knowledge and should not be so narrow that teachers only teach what’s to be assessed - it should be broader than that.
    * > However, it should not be broadened to such an extent that it becomes a range of experiences and activities which detract from the learning outcomes as identified in the curriculum. What is important is that it is appropriate to the curriculum, is well-sequenced and that key content has been remembered.

* from 'Computing Inspection Aide memoire' PDF
    * opportunity (time) to implement solutions through practical programming
    * Two programming languages(one textual)/data structures/function
    * Is there an over-reliance on online courses to teach programming?
    * Does the school over-use ‘unplugged’ activities which create unnecessary abstractions of subject content, increase cognitive load and take up curriculum time?




### Computing Quality Framework (30min)
* [Computing Quality Framework](https://computingqualityframework.org/) [[computing_quality_framework]]
    * TASK: Let's read and grade our schools (consider evidence) (15min) (10min discussion)


### Education inspection framework (30min)
* [Education inspection framework (EIF)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/education-inspection-framework?#guidance-for-education-providers)
    * [school-inspection-handbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif/school-inspection-handbook)
        * TASK: using school-inspection-handbook investigate points
            * 206 + 207 + 208 + 214 + 223
        * Prepare a set of interesting quotes from the above points
        * Questions:
            * What does 'Inspection Framework' mean for your practice?
            * Is computing mentioned in the EIF?
            * Where is computing in the [EBacc](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-baccalaureate-ebacc/english-baccalaureate-ebacc)

* > 206: In key stages 2 and 3, schools need to provide a broad, rich curriculum. Our research into the curriculum shows that these stages are particularly susceptible to a narrow curriculum, and that this has a disproportionately negative effect on the most disadvantaged pupils.
* > 223: We will judge schools taking radically different approaches to the curriculum fairly. We recognise the importance of schools’ autonomy to choose their own curriculum approaches.
* > 214 has rigour, where relevant, so that pupils learn the knowledge that they need to answer subject-specific questions and to gain disciplinary knowledge of how the subject works (this should not prevent a topic-based or thematic approach, however)
* Curriculum narrowing
    * > Our research has shown that some schools narrow the curriculum available to pupils, particularly in key stages 2 and 3.

(Async 45min + 30min breakout groups + 15min whole class == 1hour30min)





ITT Core Content Framework

> 1.1. Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.

> 1.2. Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils.

* I always refer my students to the assessment criteria. You are teachers. I will refer you to your _assessment criteria_. What criteria are schools inspected under?

TASK:
* Form groups of 2 or 3 (30min) 
* Using
    * [Ofsted: Inspections and performance of education providers](https://www.gov.uk/education/inspections-and-performance-of-education-providers)
        * [EIF](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework)
        * [School inspection handbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif)
            * (See particularly part 2 "Evaluating the quality of ...")
            * Take note of interesting paragraph numbers to facilitate the discussion below
* Consider the following questions to relay as a group (30min)
    1. What will inspectors consider when making judgements?
        * Subject specific criteria?
        * Other criteria? What are these other criteria and what evidence are they looking for?
    2. (Simply to spark discussion) What percentage or weighing of an Ofsted inspection could be subject-related/other-criteria-related/outside-of-your-control?
        * Your group will need to report your % or weightings and rational for the choice
    3. What actions could you and your department take to facilitate a successful Ofsted inspection?
        * Your group will compare your list with the other group - did you have something they missed? or vice versa?
        * (I hope you will take these as action points for your future work in schools)
* Whole class discussion/conclusions (15min)

My Notes
========

* [Ofsted: Inspections and performance of education providers](https://www.gov.uk/education/inspections-and-performance-of-education-providers)
    * [EIF](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework)
        * > The EIF is built around the idea of the connectedness of curriculum
        * > the curriculum extends beyond the academic, technical or vocational
        * > the curriculum and the provider’s wider work support learners to develop their character – including their resilience, confidence and independence – and help them know how to keep physically and mentally healthy
    * [School inspection handbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif)
        * 178. inspectors will consider the extent to which schools are equipping pupils with the knowledge and _cultural capital_ they need to succeed in life
        * 193. Inspectors will not use schools’ internal assessment data as evidence
        * 209. Inspectors will hold discussions with pupils and staff to gather evidence about school culture and practice in relation to pupils’ behaviour, support for staff and other systems.
        * 216. The curriculum provided by schools should extend beyond the academic, technical or vocational. Schools support pupils to develop in many diverse aspects of life.
        * 218. 
            * developing responsible, respectful and active citizens who are able to play their part and become actively involved in public life as adults
            * deepening pupils’ understanding of the fundamental British values of democracy, individual liberty, the rule of law and mutual respect and tolerance
            * promoting equality of opportunity 
            * developing pupils’ character,
        * 226.
            * Inspectors will use a range of evidence to evaluate personal development, including:
                * the range, quality and take-up of extra-curricular activities offered by the school
                * how curriculum subjects such as citizenship, RE, and other areas such as personal, social, health and economic education, and relationship and sex education, contribute to pupils’ personal development
                * how well leaders promote British values through the curriculum, assemblies, wider opportunities, visits, discussions and literature
                * how well leaders develop pupils’ character through the education that they provide
                * where appropriate, the quality of debate and discussions that pupils have
                * pupils’ understanding of the protected characteristics and how equality and diversity are promoted
                * the quality of careers information, education, advice and guidance, and how well it benefits pupils in choosing and deciding on their next steps.
