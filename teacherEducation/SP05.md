    * Revisit CTP activities to discuss key learning and progress
    * Discuss how your trainees subject knowledge has developed during the CTP. What are the subject knowledge priorities to facilitate teaching before Christmas?
    * Discuss how does your department plans for learning in Computing?
        * What is progress in learning and what does it look like in this subject area?
        * Look at departments individual-lessons, term-sow, year, keystage.

        * Does this department plan for learning? What are the department policies and pedagogical approaches to learning?
        * How are our choices influenced by National policy and debate? Sharing of research underpinning the departmental philosophy.
        * What is progress in learning and what does it look like in this subject area? How can I develop my own pedagogical practice?
