"Autisum isnt a disorder - it's a way of being"

* 2.2% of pupils in schools are registered as autistic in England (DfE, 2022)
    * 2.2% = 1 in 48
    * (I think there is much more) probably 1 in 5 (20%)

* A superpower
* wellbeing (your responsible?)
* attainment (your responsible?)
* High-functioning is outdated term

* What is autism
    * Social understanding and communication
    * Flexibility, information processing and understanding
    * Sensory processing and integration


* Moving away from language "Challenging" to "distressed"
    * challenging infers disobedient and confrontation
    * 

* Social friend loyalty
    * Could fight for there important friends
    * Could meltdown when their firneds spend more time with others

* Don't use metaphors - "pull your socks up"
