* [Textbooks for the teaching of computing](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/441674/1/Textbooks.pdf) John Woollard CAS 2020
    * Objectives
        1. To what extent would high-quality textbooks raise the quality of teaching and learning in computing at school?
        2. Is it advantageous to have such books available in physical hard copy?
        3. Is there a shortage of such textbooks?
        4. Where would lack of textbooks sit in a priority list of obstacles to high quality computing education at school?
        5. How can publishers be encouraged to produce materials for teaching computing?
    * Good
        * impact (statistically significant at the 5%)
        * makes authoritative, higher degree of quality assurance
        * out-of-school learning
        * independent learning, behaviour management (isolation activities)
        * Cognitive benefit of tangible textbooks. Ability to flip back and forth between pages. Provides more mental clarity
        * act as the programme of learning
    * Against
        * Outdate (external links)
        * Physical books no active element
        * Requires literacy
        * Teachers can edit/adapt
        * Cost


### Textbook Scheme of work example
We are going to explore a sample sequence of lessons

As well as free resources teachers share online. There are also paid for resources.

* [Compute-IT](https://www.hoddereducation.co.uk/compute-it) - Computing for Key Stage 3
    * Endorsed by Computing at School
    * 3 textbook series (a Computing textbox for students. How much is a class set?)
    * Additional teaching resources online
    * [Studentâ€™s Book 1](https://www.hoddereducation.com/media/Documents/ICT/801921-Compute-IT-sample-pages_1.pdf)
    * Example Lesson progression - Shapes
        * (Sample removed online)


TASK: Explore this lesson progression (15min)
Questions:
* Would you be able to teach this? Why?
* Would you want to teach this? Why?
DISCUSSION: (15min)

### Other peoples resources (15min)

> Hattie also makes the point that buying, or using, someone else's scheme of work makes teachers less effective because they spend less time thinking about the curriculum as a whole, and that teachers and departments that create their own curriculum or scheme of work have more "impact".

        * > New rule:-
          > All materials produced in school are Crown Copyright and must be made available on a public facing website in an editable format.
          > If DfE is serious about reducing teacher workload this would do it.
    * Mark Enser @EnserMark
        * > I'm not sure this would help workload. Geography teachers are great at uploading their resources on to free sharing sites but the time it has taken me to find something I want to use is always more than the time it would take me to produce it myself.

Discussion: 
* Are other teachers resources helpful to us? Why/Why not?
* How/Why/When would you use other teachers resources?
* How will you use them in your training?
