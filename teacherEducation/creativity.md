* NCCE [Beyond coding: unlocking the full potential of tech careers through creativity](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/beyond-coding/) 2024
    * > “The wider curriculum can limit us to thinking that a career in computer science equals coding. But tech and digital careers are so much more. By introducing inter-disciplinary teaching – connecting art and computer science for example – we can support students to gain a more varied skillset and improve diversity,” said Louise. 
    * > “A talented sculptor can create a complicated and beautiful sculpture, but it might be made of out a weak material that will crumble with time. Being creative without thinking about the constraints of the environment you operate in is not enough. That’s why creative and critical thinking are the sides of the same coin.”

    * All kids have tremendous talents and we squander them
    * Creativity should be treated with the same status as literacy

    * We get educated out of creativity

        * > Doleck et al. [9] examined the relationship between creative thinking and academic performance and found no relationship between the two.

        * > self-reported levels of creativity did not at all correlate with their final grades.
          > On the other hand, the tests that did correlate with their final grades did not correlate with their self-reports. 
          > This suggests that although we’re assessing one type of creativity or divergent thinking, it is not necessarily the same thing students conceptualize as “creativity” within the CS domain.

    * Example Course (Slide 32)
        * Weeks 1 to 2
            * Individual choice from a range of work provided by the teacher.
            * Student self-assessment using materials provided
        * Weeks 3 to 6
            * Children construct own problems like those in weeks 1 and 2 and select structured math apparatus to aid solutions
        * Weeks 7 to 10
            * Children presented with a new learning objectives, and make up their own problems, without exemplars by the teacher
        * Weeks 11 to 14
            * Children set their own learning objectives, construct appropriate problems, and use appropriate self-assessment
        * Weeks 15 to 20
            * As weeks 1 to 14, but with less monitoring from the teacher and increased freedom of choice and personal responsibility
    * WHAT? .. is this grounded in reality? Many adults can't do this?

    * Situated learning was proposed by Lave and Wenger (1991), who stated that learning is a psychological process of individual meaning construction and a participatory process of surrounding situations. Learning situations are the key to stimulating learners’ internal and external learning motivations and to enabling learners to transform abstract perceptions into concrete thinking (Clancey, 1995)

===============

* The article below is not directly related to education - It's an attempt to define creativity in a computational sense
* [Towards a computational theory of epistemic creativity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283778374_Towards_a_computational_theory_of_epistemic_creativity) 2015 Wiedermann University of Kent [pdf](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/events/2015/AISB2015/proceedings/computationalCreativity/CC2015_submission_3.pdf)
    * > The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works (David Deutsch)
    *  the definitions (of creativity) are very informal, given in a natural language, 
    *  the definitions (of creativity) hardly ever mention the term knowledge
    *  > “actually creating new knowledge or combining existing fragments of knowledge in altogether new ways (Mokyer)
    *  > The classical view (of computation) favours the view of HOW computations are performed, instead of WHAT they are doing
    *  cognition is knowledge generation
    *  > Can we be more specific in describing which knowledge generating processes can be seen as creative processes? What are the prerequisites for computational creativity?
    * "analogy solving" is elementary creativity (and measurable?)
        * > Solving an analogy can be seen as an elementary creativity act that calls for discovering and displaying new relations between known pieces of knowledge
        * You need understanding of multiple topics/domains/systems to link them together
    * > “analogy is a figure of language that expresses a set of like relations among two sets of terms
    * analogies create understanding between something unknown by relating it to something known
    * Logically and formally - objects that have more relations are preferred (see section 3.2 of article for :shark:🐫 :desert-lion example)
    * > 'taxonomy' dealing with classification of things or concepts based on sharing similar features
    * > A 'metaphor' is an expression of language that describes a subject by comparing it with another unrelated subject resembling the original subject only in some semantic aspects
        * e.g. > "time is money"
    * > Allegories are typically used as literary devices or rhetorical devices that convey hidden meanings through symbolic figures, actions, imagery, and/or events, which together create the moral, spiritual,or political meaning the author wishes to convey
    * Syntactic knowledge mining (traditional AI - searching for patterns in known data/knowledge)
    * Semantic knowledge mining
        * is the main engine of creativity.
        * is formed in a natural language ... This complicates the searches since the meaning of linguistic terms must be known. The meaning of each term is, in fact, a piece of knowledge
        * calls for detecting similarities between theories usually related to different knowledge domains
    * Unfortunately, general mechanisms of semantic knowledge discovery, explanations and understanding are largely unknown
    * > creative process is not a special type of computation to begin with but a whole collection of computations as also seen from the schema of resolving explanatory analogies
    * > the larger the knowledge base the greater the potential for discovering new knowledge ... and the creative agent must have a command of natural language in order to be able to navigate among various knowledge domains
