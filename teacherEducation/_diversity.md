    * It would be arrogant of me to assume I can preach about this topic
    * My world experience is exceptionally limited. I have few answers.
    * I feel scared and awkward delivering this topic
* Opportunity ...
* Goals
    * I have some insight with my observations with teaching in schools
    * You have insight that can help me grow (advice about my undergrad class's)
    * We will explore though discussion as humanly as possible
    * Unsure of how far we will get


Objectives
----------

* KSQ8: Broad and Balanced Curriculum
    * Hidden/Invisible Curriculum

---

Moral and Practical

> Education professionals are morally compelled to ensure that all students feel accepted, safe, and are represented in their classes.

Define (15min)
------

* TASK: 
    * Write down in your own words definitions of the following terms (6min)
    * Compare them with a peer (3min)
    * (are you aligned?)
* Define
    * Diversity
    * Inclusion

### Definitions 

(quick copy and paste from the web)

* Diversity
    * > the practice or quality of including or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual orientations, etc.
* Inclusion
    * > the practice or policy of providing equal access to opportunities and resources for people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized
* Diversity vs Inclusion
    * > Diversity refers to the traits and characteristics that make people unique while inclusion refers to the behaviors and social norms that ensure people feel welcome.







When have you felt excluded? (15min)
----------------------------

* My PE story - teachers response (2min)
* Your story? Think Pair Share (10min)


Cultural alienation
-------------------

#### Adult/Employment Context (10min)

* > Did you see the game last night?
* As an illustration: Nursery rhymes - if you can - join in with me
    * Little Miss Muffit
    * Bar Bar Black sheep

Do any members of your team feel excluded, alienated, outsiders?

* Micro-aggression training from employers
    * (you are not a robot, but)
    * Keep talk at work focused on work 
    * Personally connecting with your colleagues one to one with a shared identity is ok.
    * More than two people; be mindful of others cultural alienation.
    * If this is sustained this could be considered a micro-aggression

(With this in mind - how does this transfer to the school context. School student communities are more than 2 or 3 adults in an office)

#### School Context

* Lesson Content
    * Decolonising the Curriculum
        * Ongoing discussions
    * Relevant to the students lives
        * Careers, Local Context, Community
    * Unconscious cultural assumptions
        * Your students are not you
        * My example in Computing: Games
            * > Teach with games - everybody loves games
            * > Please don't suggest a game ...
    * TASK: Personal reflection: What could be your unconscious cultural assumptions about your subject? (3min)
* Student interactions?
    * ???



Request for support and Advice - My Undergraduate class's
------------------

* Context
    * 1st year undergraduates
    * Introduction to programming
    * Lab size of 40 (another 40 online)
    * Workshop is 4 hours
* Set first task
* Many students peer support and engage
    * Culturally integrated
    * Confident
* Select few don't engage 
    * (with the task due to weak skills)
    * (socially - confidence?)
    * Withdrawn (hoody up)
    * Took me 40min to identify some of them
* Advised to actively engage and seek support
* This is the first task - what is the rest of their degree going to look like?

TASK: (10min)
* What do I do?



Unconscious Bias
----------------

![Cognative Bias Codex](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg) 
<sub>from [designhacks.co](https://designhacks.co/)</sub>

* Unconscious Bias testing
    * Crude tests, but interesting
    * [Implicit Association Test (IAT)](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)
        * Reaction time to association of images and words to uncover possible bias
        * 10min each (need quiet focused space to take them)
        * Lots of topics - religion, sexuality, etc


Unsorted
========

* Broaden your sources of opinion and information 
    * If someone is making an argument - ask them for the inverse - someone genuinely informed can answer this



* Who are the 5 people you interact with the most in school?
* Does the school staff reflect the school community? 
* Who might not feel included in the staffroom?

    * Anecdotal evidence
        * > This is a difficult discussion to have. I think that another reason that we keep returning to the same controversies is that we mostly rely on anecdotal evidence. As we progress through our careers, we observe what works and what doesn't, but it's likely that confirmation bias makes us remember the results that we already favour, whereas we conveniently forget about the outcomes that don't fit our preferred narrative.
        * > Could we settle these discussions with more science? Alas, that's difficult.
        * > I can't think of anything better, then, than keep having the same discussions over and over. I try hard to overcome my biases to understand the other side, and now and then, I learn something that I find illuminating. It doesn't seem to be a particularly efficient way to address these difficult questions, but I don't know what else to do. What's the alternative to discussion? To not discuss? To not exchange ideas? That seems worse.



* Criticality
    * [twitter/X](https://twitter.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1782856671091380497)
        * > Does diversity make teams work better?
          > Apparently not!
          > A new, comprehensive preregistered meta-analysis found that, whether the diversity was demographic, cognitive, or occupational, its relationship with performance was near-zero.
