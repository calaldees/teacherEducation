SQ 6: How do you plan and assess for learning?
-----------------------------------------------

Structuring learning that is informed and supported by assessment

* Learning Objectives (for the spotlight question)
    * Understand how to identify and make critical and effective use of assessment approaches and data to inform and support planning, teaching, learning and progress  
    * Sequencing and structuring learning over time to secure learning and progress for all learners
    * Recognise key ways of thinking in educational research

* Mentor WB 20th Nov
    * How does the department use AfL to inform practice and curriculum development, how is it evident in planning?  What is good practice?
    * How does AfL inform the structure of learning in lessons?
    * How does the department: 
        * use feedback?
            * #6/h-Assessment-LearnHow-feedback_appropriate_for_learner
        * use self assessment?
            * #6/n-Assessment-LearnHow-feedback_self
        * use peer assessment?
            * Task: find an example of how this has been scaffolded
            * #6/n-Assessment-LearnHow-feedback_peer 
    * How is homework used to inform AfL?
        * Task: Find an example for each keystage of How homework is linked to the main class learning. Is this effective? #4/11-Classroom-LearnThat-homework_linked

Concluding Remarks
-------

* Goal (of teaching in general): To make yourself obsolete
    * Students should
        * know the goals
        * know the components of how to get there
        * judge their own progress (and progress of others) accurately
    * Your role is to engineer/design/control the environment for maximum progress
        * Not to lecture - not be sole/dependent the source of information - not to mark everything, all the time, on your own
