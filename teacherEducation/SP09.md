SQ 6: How do you plan and assess for learning?
-----------------------------------------------

Structuring learning that is informed and supported by assessment

* Learning Objectives
    * Understand how to identify and make critical and effective use of assessment approaches and data to inform and support planning, teaching, learning and progress  
    * Sequencing and structuring learning over time to secure learning and progress for all learners
    * Recognise key ways of thinking in educational research



Overview
--------

* TASK: Your collective knowledge about assessment
    * You've had a reasonable amount of time in school and talked to your mentors. You know (something) about assessment
    * > Morpheus: Show me

<details>

* Goal: To make yourself obsolete
    * Students should 
        * know the goals
        * know the components of how to get there
        * judge their own progress (and progress of others) accurately
    * Your role is to engineer/design/control the environment for maximum progress
        * Not to lecture - not be sole/dependent the source of information - not to mark everything, all the time, on your own
