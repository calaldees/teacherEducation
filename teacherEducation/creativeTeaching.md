Creative Teaching (1 hour)
=================

* See also [[creativity]]

Getting Started
---------------

* How could you rate the value of someone's creative output?

<details>

* [The Four C Model of Creativity](https://www.waldenu.edu/online-masters-programs/ms-in-education/resource/the-four-c-model-of-creativity) Kaufman  2009
    * Mini C - any attempt at new task (meaningful/value to learner)
    * Little C - might be of value to others
    * Pro C - professional value
    * Big C (Einstein) - value to the world
</details>


Some thoughts
-------------

* Teach a prescribed curriculum - assessed centrally
    * Lack of risk taking
* Where session slides are created centrally and teachers are expected to follow them, in the name of standardisation.
    * The internet is now here ... trainees can just download resources rather than make them
* Ofsted reports and inspection guidance don't focus on creativity.
    * Has a school ever failed an inspection by being not creative enough?
* [[CCF]] (2019) - does not mention creativity
* National Curriculum
    * [computing](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study)
        * > A high-quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world.
        * > undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple applications
    * [Mathematics](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study)
        * > is a creative and highly interconnected discipline
    * [English](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-english-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-english-programmes-of-study)
        * > This is not intended to constrain or restrict teachers’ creativity
* [[ofstedComputing]] 2022 review says
    * > creativity to understand and change the world
    * > confident in using applications in creative projects
    * not overlay much
* 'good behaviour' is valued more than creativity....?
* Trainees prefer didactic and transmissive teaching mechanisms
* Computing curriculum
    * ICT - they can use it to express other ideas
    * How could you be creative with Digital literacy? Computer science? eSaftey? - humm ...
* Overall?
    * The education 'system' does not value creativity
    * Humans (as a collective) value creativity


TASK: Discuss 10min?
* agree/disagree - why?
* Are we allowed to be creative?
* Can creativity be prescribed? - on-demand
* How can creativity be recognised?
* Do we value creativity?
* Should we be creative in our teaching?


"The Creativity Conundrum"
--------------------------

* Creativity 
    * comes with uncertainty and 'risk'
    * is difficult to measure
* Risks required to reach _outstanding_
* Nobody can become autonomous leaner without being creative

> Louie Armstrong cant be creative if he doesn't know what end of the trumpet to blow into
* base skills?
* 'pallet' of skills?

* encourage trainees to be subversive?!
* If we are creative, how does that help them?
* Can't just go from 0 to creative in 6.5 seconds


Literature
----------

* [Creativity in Education](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1754-8845.2005.tb00624.x) (2005) Hodges
    * Hodges (2005, p4)
        * > 'learning, motivation and enjoyment' are compromised at the cost of assessment targets
    * This build on the definition from NACCCEE (1999) that defines creativity as 'imaginative activity fashioned to produce outcomes that are both original and of value' (p30)
* [The Durham Commission on Creativity in Education](https://www.dur.ac.uk/creativitycommission/report/) 2020
    * Definitions (pg4)
        * Creativity: 
            * The capacity to imagine, conceive, express, or make something that was not there before
        * Creative thinking: 
            * A process through which knowledge, intuition and skills are applied to imagine, express or make something novel or individual in its contexts. Creative thinking is present in all areas of life. It may appear spontaneous, but it can be underpinned by perseverance, experimentation, critical thinking and collaboration
        * Teaching for creativity: 
            * Explicitly using pedagogies and practices that cultivate creativity in young people
    * > Unless an aspect of creativity is specified by a particular syllabus it is unlikely to be developed in busy, results-concious schools. Many examinations at GCSE level and above invariably focus on knowledge recall and leave less scope for creative questioning and problem-solving, or the exercise of curiosity though deep enquiry
        * pg 55
    * [10 Recommendations](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/Durham_Commission_on_Creativity_04112019_0.pdf) artscouncil.org.uk
        * should be recognised in the Ofsted inspection process
        * Higher education institutions ... to develop research informed practice to evaluate creativity, looking at how creativity and creative thinking can be identified across disciplines, and how its impact can be measured.
        * training for teachers in digital literacy and digital creativity, with time and resource committed to it.
        * diverse routes to take part in creative activities outside of school hours.
* Collard and Looney (2014) argue that for learning to be creative, teachers need to see creativity as a process in which they 'build learners' own competence to assess the quality of their ideas.
    * confidence issue - because of differing definitions and policy offered to educators
        * pg 49

Flow Theory
-----------

* [Flow in Education](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080448947006084) Schmidt 2010
    * Abstract
        * Flow refers to a state of total absorption in the task at hand; a merging of action and experience where the individual loses track of both time and self. 
        * Researchers have identified several conditions under which the flow experience tends to emerge.
        * Two of these conditions – high levels of challenge matched to an individual’s skills – are often present in educational environments,
        * but other important conditions are largely absent in classrooms, with the result that students do not experience flow in school as often as one might expect.
    * Graph
        * Challenge Low->High
        * Skill Low->High
        * (more challenge than skill == anxiety)
        * (more skill than challenge == boredom)


Example ideas for the Computing Classroom
------------------------------------------

* What might creatively look like in Computing as a catalyst to you looking at your own subjects ...
* "Pallet" analogy

### Concept 1: Demoscene

* What is [demoscene](https://github.com/calaldees/mapOfComputing/blob/main/computing/demoscene.md)?
    * [Top 50 Greatest Amiga Cracktros - Awesome Amiga Crack Intro Music Mix ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Vb5Bdyp7Y)
* My story
    * DNA Logo
        * https://github.com/calaldees/TeachProgramming/blob/master/teachprogramming/static/projects/creativeCodingWorkshop.md
* Greets
    * https://youtu.be/1NI-0Vpgu3A?si=MkCHtCLTJ3j5vQ3v&t=46
* Font Project
    * Create Raster Font
    * https://github.com/calaldees/TeachProgramming/blob/master/teachprogramming/static/projects/font.md
    * Demoscene Greets
    * What is your 'Hacker' name/alias?
    * Combine code from multiple people (the first time they would have collaborated on a software project)
* Templates for weaker students
* Assessment criteria linked to curriculum goals (Self/Peer useable)
    * Used a function
    * Called a function in a function
    * Bounded iteration
    * Unbounded iteration
    * Nested iteration
    * List/Array data structure
    * Appended to data structure / removed from datastructure
    * Meaningful variable names
* Pallet
    * Run a program to keep updating screen
    * Load image
    * Draw image at x/y
    * Array datastructure - loop though string

### Concept 2: Escape room

* Escape room!
    * Work on a puzzle (individual) - combine as team - theme
* Pallet
    * https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/step-counter/
    * Use of sensors
    * Use of network
    * Logic to make an action
* Assessment criteria based on complexity of solution generated
    * Not marked on "asthenic" or "theming" or "quality of handwriting"


### Takeaways

* Define your "pallet" of skills
    * What do students needs to know be creative
* Assessment criteria must be grounded in subject/curriculum/course goals
    * Crazy idea ... Maybe combine two or more subjects?
* Templates
    * Some students cant go from 0 to creative.
    * Provide scaffolds/railroad/guidence/example for the weaker - everyone should be participating
* Students must have autonomy
* Individual accountability (not hide in a group)
* Suggestions
    * Students must have an opertunity (space/equipment) to work on projects outside of

Task (30min)
----

Now you have an example

* How could you use creativity in your subject?
* Consider
    * Pallet (what skills do they need before they can start combining ideas autonomously?)
    * Assessment criteria (how will they know 'what' to focus on and judge their own progress)
    * Templates (for the weaker)
* Individual (silent) 5min
* Pair 10min
* Share 15min



Risk Taking (40min)
------------------

Support trainee teachers to take risks - mentor conversation?

* We can keep things 'safe' in the same cookie cutter ...
* We can't get better unless we try new ideas ...
* Consider: 
    * Cross curricular (see broad and balanced curriculum)
    * External to the school?

* TASK1 (10min): Individual: Consider a range of teaching strategies and ideas that you would be interested in trying in you ECT years
* TASK2 (10min): Pairs: Discuss ideas. What would be the 'risk' in trying these ideas? How could we reduce the risk?
* TASK3 (10min): Whole group relay
(10min): Tutor ideas ...

Consider:
* 'SLT Test' - If SLT walked in, would you be able to justify your approach

<details>

* 'Game' or 'Phone' test plan - tick list
* School Field (Networks)
* Screwdriver + Computer + Put back together
* Competition with another class (clear criteria?)
* Present at another school?
* Anonymous peer marking (test software?)
* Ask for genuine feedback - students struggle with writing (literacy?) 
    - allow verbal discussion with your outside (window wave 10-15min?) 
    - class rep? (must relay all ideas even if they do not agree with them) 
    - provide scaffold focus points. 
        - Simplify "I don't mind if you don't like me. I do mind if you do not feel that you've made progress". 
        - Formative for me/teacher. It's hard to look in the mirror.

* Suggestion: Implement these ideas After Christmas? (You have to know your class)

* Organising game tournaments (over to them!)

speed coding
* class teach another class
    * Year 10/11?
* debate - dramatise it up

measure class over 3 years - ethical?
