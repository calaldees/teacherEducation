Unplugged concept - School Friend? or Hall?
---------

3 lessons total
Lesson before to prepare - dry run in classroom
Lesson after to consolidate - with exam questions

Combine with PE teacher for 2 hours and extra supervision (hard because they have their own adgenda)
skills with crowd control and time sprints between routers (not much for the PE teacher to focus and build - it's a computing lesson)

Field 
    half class routers with rules - half class carring messages (recording times between hops) - ise 32bit ipv4 address's
    or
    three - routers, packets, endpoints (servers+client)
class swap to do other role
Next lesson Calculcate round trip time

Some paths load balanced
Some webservers with printouts of html, css and images (images on different server)
Timeout for round trip
DNS list of ip's 
site.com
static.aws.com (s3 storage for images)
request a large image in multiple parts (two pages of A4 for images) - HTTP Multipart byte range header (kind of fake misconception but also useful)
one large jump to show trans-atlantic cable

request GET /page2.html HTTP1.1
