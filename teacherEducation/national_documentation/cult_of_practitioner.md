Sue Fields CCCU ITE Research

Cult of the practitioner to the expert practitioner

Secret Garden of the classroom - when the door is closed, we can just get on with our own agenda

ITE - not much research - fragmented (not large) - limited international

Literature tells us to use research - but there is very little ITE research

We need to create a 'language' for this domain

Only established and powerful insitutions can research challenging/antithetical questions. The little researchers would loose reputiation for asking the question; e.g. critcing ofsted.

(wait, other universitys get 3 days a week to do research and you've just said that there is no way we could do that, but you want publications and more doctoral staff)
