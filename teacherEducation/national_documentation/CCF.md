### Learn that
1. Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils. #1/1-HighExp-LearnThat-improve_motivation_wellbeing
2. Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils. #1/2-HighExp-LearnThat-role_model
3. Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential. #1/3-HighExp-LearnThat-expectation_stretch
4. Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture. #1/4-HighExp-LearnThat-expectation_clear
5. A culture of mutual trust and respect supports effective relationships. #1/5-HighExp-LearnThat-culture_of_respect_trust
6. High-quality teaching has a long-term positive effect on pupils’ life chances, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. #1/6-HighExp-LearnThat-long_term_impact_disadvantaged

### Learn how to

1. Communicate a belief in the academic potential of all pupils, by:

## How Pupils Learn (Standard 2 – ‘Promote good progress’)

### Learn that
1. Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding. #2/1-HowLearn-LearnThat-learning_is_lasting
2. Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas. #2/2-HowLearn-LearnThat-prior_knowledge_identified
3. An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory. #2/3-HowLearn-LearnThat-working-memory
4. Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded. #2/4-HowLearn-LearnThat-working_memory
5. Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge. #2/5-HowLearn-LearnThat-integrating_long_term_memory
6. Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly. #2/6-HowLearn-LearnThat-misconceptions
7. Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned. #2/7-HowLearn-LearnThat-regular_practice
8. Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall. #2/8-HowLearn-LearnThat-spaced_retrieval
9. Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn. #2/9-HowLearn-LearnThat-worked_examples

### Learn how to

1. Avoid overloading working memory, by:
    1. a Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to take into account pupils’ prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce. #2/a-HowLearn-LearnHow-prior_knowledge_in_planning
    2. b Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to reduce distractions that take attention away from what is being taught (e.g. keeping the complexity of a task to a minimum, so that attention is focused on the content).  #2/b-HowLearn-LearnHow-reduce_distractions_increase_focus
2. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at: 
    1. c Breaking complex material into smaller steps (e.g. using partially completed examples to focus pupils on the specific steps). #2/c-HowLearn-LearnHow-small_steps
3. Build on pupils’ prior knowledge, by: 
    1. d Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to sequence lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before encountering more complex content.  #2/d-HowLearn-LearnHow-sequence_foundations
    2. e Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to identify possible misconceptions and plan how to prevent these forming.  #2/e-HowLearn-LearnHow-identify_misconception
4. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at: 
    1. f Encouraging pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so that misconceptions can be addressed #2/f-HowLearn-LearnHow-pupils_share_understanding
    2. g Linking what pupils already know to what is being taught (e.g. explaining how new content builds on what is already known). #2/g-HowLearn-LearnHow-link_prior_knowledge
5. Increase likelihood of material being retained, by:
    1. h Observing how expert colleagues plan regular review and practice of key ideas and concepts over time (e.g. through carefully planned use of structured talk activities) and deconstructing this approach. #2/h-LearnHow-structure-concepts-over-time
    2. i Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to design practice, generation and retrieval tasks that provide just enough support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting challenging work.#2/i-HowLearn-LearnHow-plan_review
6. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at: 
    1. j Balancing exposition, repetition, practice and retrieval of critical knowledge and skills. #2/j-HowLearn-LearnHow-balance_exposition_repetition_practice_retrieval 
    2. k Increasing challenge with practice and retrieval as knowledge becomes more secure (e.g. by removing scaffolding, lengthening spacing or introducing interacting elements) #2/k-HowLearn-LearnHow-increase_challenge


## Subject and Curriculum (Standard 3 – ‘Demonstrate good subject and curriculum knowledge’)

### Learn that
1. A school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the national curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning. #3/1-SubjCur-LearnThat-curriculum_breath
2. Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively. #3/2-SubjCur-LearnThat-good_subject_knowledge_motivates
3. Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed. #3/3-SubjCur-LearnThat-mastery_is_confidence
4. Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable. #3/4-SubjCur-LearnThat-anticipate_misconceptions
5. Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial. #3/5-SubjCur-LearnThat-explicit_instruction
6. In order for pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about. #3/6-SubjCur-LearnThat-criticality_requires_knowledge
7. In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important. #3/7-SubjCur-LearnThat-link_schemata
8. Pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context. #3/8-SubjCur-LearnThat-discipline_transfer_context
9. To access the curriculum, early literacy provides fundamental knowledge; reading comprises two elements: word reading and language comprehension; systematic synthetic phonics is the most effective approach for teaching pupils to decode. #3/9-SubjCur-LearnThat-literacy_terminology_vocabulary
10. Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines  #3/10-SubjCur-LearnThat-responsibility_for_literacy

    5.  s Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to teach different forms of writing by modelling planning, drafting and editing. #3/s-SubjCur-LearnHow-model-different-forms-of-writing
10. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at: 
    1.  t Teaching unfamiliar vocabulary explicitly and planning for pupils to be repeatedly exposed to high-utility and high-frequency vocabulary in what is taught. #3/t-SubjCur-LearnHow-build_verbal_fluency
    2.  u Modelling and requiring high-quality oral language, recognising that spoken language underpins the development of reading and writing (e.g. requiring pupils to respond to questions in full sentences, making use of relevant technical vocabulary). #3/u-SubjCur-LearnHow-build_verbal_terminology

## Classroom Practice (Standard 4 – ‘Plan and teach well structured lessons’)

### Learn that
1. Effective teaching can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning. #4/1-Classroom-LearnThat-effective_can_transform
2. Effective teachers introduce new material in steps, explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned. #4/2-Classroom-LearnThat-small_steps_link_prior_knowledge_schemata
3. Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible. #4/3-Classroom-LearnThat-model_concrete_abstract
4. Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases. #4/4-Classroom-LearnThat-remove_scaffolds
5. Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success. #4/5-Classroom-LearnThat-build_metacognitive_explicit
6. Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems. #4/6-Classroom-LearnThat-questioning_feedback
7. High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary. #4/7-Classroom-LearnThat-build_verbal_fluency
8. Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success. #4/8-Classroom-LearnThat-repetition_practice
9. Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice. #4/9-Classroom-LearnThat-group_pair_guidance
10. How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation. #4/10-Classroom-LearnThat-group_pair_monitor
11. Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils, but it is likely that the quality of homework and its relevance to main class teaching is more important than the amount set.  #4/11-Classroom-LearnThat-homework_linked

scaffold talk?

### Learn how to

1. Plan effective lessons, by:
    1. a Observing how expert colleagues break tasks down into constituent components when first setting up independent practice (e.g. using tasks that scaffold pupils through meta-cognitive and procedural processes) and deconstructing this approach.  #4/a-Classroom-LearnHow-observe_task_breakdown

    3. p Providing appropriate wait time between question and response where more developed responses are required. #4/p-Classroom-LearnHow-thinking_time


## Adaptive Teaching (Standard 5 – ‘Adapt teaching’)

### Learn that

1. Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed. #5/1-AdaptTeach-LearnThat-pupils_different
2. Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching. #5/2-AdaptTeach-LearnThat-prior_knowledge
3. Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success. #5/3-AdaptTeach-LearnThat-targeted_support
4. Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils. #5/4-AdaptTeach-LearnThat-no_separate_tasks_ssdd
5. Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils. #5/5-AdaptTeach-LearnThat-group_pair_monitor
6. There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial. #5/6-AdaptTeach-LearnThat-no_learning_styles
7. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.  #5/7-AdaptTeach-LearnThat-special_needs_wider

## Assessment (Standard 6 – ‘Make accurate and productive use of assessment’)

### Learn that
1. Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs. #6/1-Assessment-LearnThat-assess_needs
2. Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear. #6/2-Assessment-LearnThat-quantify
3. Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use. #6/3-Assessment-LearnThat-justify
4. To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect. #6/4-Assessment-LearnThat-pupil_action
5. High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve. #6/5-Assessment-LearnThat-feedback_specific
6. Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning. #6/6-Assessment-LearnThat-pupils_action
7. Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload. #6/7-Assessment-LearnThat-proportionate-workload

### Learn how to

1. Avoid common assessment pitfalls, by:
