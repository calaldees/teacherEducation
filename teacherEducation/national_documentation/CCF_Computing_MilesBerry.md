TS1 Set high expectations


1. Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils. 
The challenge of engagement - balance between theory and practical computing. Avoiding distractions. Establishing routines.
 2. Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils. 
Share your passion. Share your experience. Work hard and expect pupils to do so. Ethics, inclusion and diversity in CS.
 3. Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential. 
Programming is hard - this is why it’s fun! High expectations; lots of support; need for hard work. 
 4. Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture. 
Emphasise ethics, inclusion and diversity. Willingness to learn from our mistakes.
 5. A culture of mutual trust and respect supports effective relationships. 
Annotating code for team members to allow the project to progress 
 6. High-quality teaching has a long-term positive effect on pupils’ life chances, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. 
Just like the idea that ‘everyone can cook’, we should promote the idea that ‘everyone can code,’ whatever one’s background. It simply requires each one to find the best way forward.
TS2 Promote good progress


1. Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding. 
It’s not enough for them to be able to answer the question / write their program today - it matters that they can do that next week, or next term.
2. Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas.  
Can we assume everyone joining Y7 knows Scratch, can type, and can use Windows? What if they can’t?
What are the key facts for computing? Does this relate to The Big Ideas? It’s not really the definition of ‘algorithm’, or how to indent Python is it? Binary values are probably on the list. The difference between the web and the internet is.
3. An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory. 
Breaking down a problem into chunks increases understanding and facilitates the use of memory
4. Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded. 
So we need to get to a point of fluency in their programming where they can focus on semantics rather than syntax. Scratch helps, but they should be able to do this for text-based programming too.
5. Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge. 
There’s a nice metaphor here for memory in a computer - cache as working memory; SDD as long term memory??
The web is about making connections; as is memory?
6. Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly. 
Constant recapping and building on prior knowledge. Scaffolding skills. Being adaptive though so that if a misconception is found, the lesson is changed to address the misconception
7. Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned.   
Where do we find resources to support this? 
8. Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall.  
Is there a way to make spaced retrieval relevant? Can we find ways to build on ideas studied previously in the work they are doing now?
9. Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn. 
Lots of live coding (there’s research on this), as well as modelling other processes. Later, this becomes modelling answers to exam questions.
TS3 Demonstrate good subject and curriculum knowledge


1. A school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the national curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning. 
We start from the NC POS, including the entitlement to computing at KS4. Much is determined by exam specifications. Essay 1 looks at the rationales for computing - valuable technical skill; making sense of the modern world; analytical and systematic problem solving
2. Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively. 
There may be areas you haven’t covered/ thought about in a long time, you MUST revisit these, any lack of confidence can be seen and you want to be able to answer a wide range of questions. (Especially important in a subject that updates regularly).
3. Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed. 
Essay 2 looks in detail at planning. Construct Maps (after Rich), as used by NCCE help with carefully considering the sequence of component knowledge. Emphasis in planning on teaching one thing well in foundation / development phases. 
4. Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable. 
Addressed through lesson planning process. We discuss common misconceptions in subject knowledge / pedagogy lectures. Sorva’s work helps here, and we’re building up knowledge of common issues - box model of variables, simplifications of memory and processors, flow control in loops, arrays vs lists…
5. Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial. 
Beyond component knowledge, there are some meta strategies relevant for computing - debugging, Googling error message, reading documentation, asking intelligent questions, avoiding learned helplessness
6. In order for pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about. 
This is really important in softer areas of the subject - online safety, privacy, security, ethics, AI, but also matters with HCI and other design aspects
7. In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important. 
Again Kathy Rich / NCCE work on learning tractories is helpful here, and we draw on this in our discussions of lesson planning and medium term planning. Also relevant to adaptive teaching re gaps in knowledge.
8. Pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context. 
Acknowledged through presentation of computational thinking as directly relevant to programming and other aspected of automating the solution of problems.
9. To access the curriculum, early literacy provides fundamental knowledge; reading comprises two elements: word reading and language comprehension; systematic synthetic phonics is the most effective approach for teaching pupils to decode. 
Phonics is addressed explicitly in AI and inclusion lectures re text to speech and speech to text systems, including how graphemes are associated with different phonemes in other languages. 
10. Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines. 
We draw parallels between writing and coding in relation to students’ own academic writing. 
Lecture on questioning places emphasis on the development of oracy. 
TS4 Plan and teach well structured lessons


1. Effective teaching can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning. 
What does effective teaching look like in computing? Rosenshine’s principles and Ofsted’s expectations in the context of computing lessons. NCCE How we teach computing. Other lists of tips for teaching programming / computing, including the evidence base. 
2. Effective teachers introduce new material in steps, explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned. 
Learning trajectories. Constructive alignment. Building in retrieval. Use of ‘do now’ to ensure firm foundations for building new knowledge.
3. Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible. 
Modelling as worked examples. Notional machines and the need to read code / make predictions. PRIMM.
4. Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases. 
PRIMM as an example of a scaffolded process, with emphasis on make phase. I do / we do / you do based planning. Differences between novice and expert coders. 
5. Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success. 
As above, debugging, Googling error messages, reading documentation, asking intelligent questions, avoiding learned helplessness, testing strategies. Supporting and encouraging pupils’ independent learning - e.g. code club, coder dojo, robotics clubs, links between programming and gaming. Strategies for building engagement. 
6. Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems. 
Use of questions whilst pupils are working independently to promote greater thought, to help in finding errors, to suggest improvements; encouraging a community of enquiry; what if approaches to developing notional machines.
7. High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.  
Value in working through examples together as a class. Value in having pupils demonstrate things on the board. Encourage peer-to-peer talk through peer instruction and pair programming.
8. Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success. 
Learn from what happens in the best maths lessons – worked examples and then lots of independent practice, with well-structured variation. Provide opportunity for meaningful programming tasks.
9. Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice. 
Pair programming and peer instruction. Collaborative group projects. Take care that pair programming focuses on learning rather than outcomes. Consider swapping roles regularly.
10. How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation. 
Approaches to pair programming and ensuring its effectiveness in learning. Interactive, whole-class teaching. 
11. Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils, but it is likely that the quality of homework and its relevance to main class teaching is more important than the amount set.  
Useful to set recap and retrieval exercises for homework? Modify and Make tasks in PRIMM? What about independent, extended programming projects at GCSE? Lots of opportunity for independent learning in CS, especially programming for well-motivated students. A place for flipped learning?
TS5 Adapt Teaching


1. Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed. 
Scaffolding programming tasks for some – partial programs, subgoal labels, working code to modify or extend
2. Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching. 
Prior experience matters. Guzdial on learner centred design is relevant. Universal design for learning.
3. Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success. 
Helping / supporting pupils when engaged in activities. Developing cultural relevance / responsiveness. Drawing on ideas from UDL.
4. Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.  
Emphasis on interactive whole class teaching and developing a classroom in which pupils support one another. Drawing on insights from UDL. One task, many approaches.
5. Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils. 
Use of pair programming and its extension to other aspects of the subject. Peer instruction (MCQ based) and its application to computing. Change in programming requirements at GCSE open up possibilities for more group work.
6. There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial. 
Stress dual coding and other aspects of multimedia learning theory, including the evidence base for this.
7. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.
Use of assistive technology including AI to make the curriculum more accessible for pupils with some SEN. Teaching inclusive design as part of HCI in programming, and looking at accessibility guidance for design based work.
TS6 Make accurate and productive use of assessment


1. Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs. 
Diagnostic questions, and construction of distractors which reveal misconceptions. 
Item level analysis of test data. Pre-test/post-test progress tracking (Essay 2)
2. Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear. 
Use of hinge questions for the whole class. Use the computers to collect answers from everyone. Analyse the data.
Autograding for code. Parsons’s Problems
3. Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use.  
Ethics and big data. School performance table analysis. Evidence of progress. Pre-test / post-test. Item level analysis in Excel.
4. To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect. 
If you do a multichoice quiz during a lesson, how do the results affect your planning?
5. High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve. 
Feedback on programming includes the output from the compiler / interpreter and a linter. Tight feedback cycle as pupils can tell whether their code works or not. With programming challenges, is the answer correct?
6. Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning. 
Value of independent access to MCQs like Diagnostic Questions.
7. Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload. 
Standard approaches, such as MCQ item banks, Parsons’s Problems, programming challenges
TS7 Manage behaviour effectively


1. Establishing and reinforcing routines, including through positive reinforcement, can help create an effective learning environment. 
Particular challenges of working in a lab. Dealing with off-task computer use. Use of Impero etc monitoring software. Positive use of screen sharing.
 2. A predictable and secure environment benefits all pupils, but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs. 
Extension of predictable and secure to the online environment. Need for consistency, accessibility and reliability in online tools. Work with network technicians.
 3. The ability to self-regulate one’s emotions affects pupils’ ability to learn, success in school and future lives. 
Key applications of this to online safety / responsibility. Privacy and security in relation to monitoring software. Awareness of digital footprint and terms and conditions. Legal requirements. Rights.
 4. Teachers can influence pupils’ resilience and beliefs about their ability to succeed, by ensuring all pupils have the opportunity to experience meaningful success. 
Adaptive teaching. Starting with pupils’ own interests and enthusiasms. Digital making. Links to UDL.
 5. Building effective relationships is easier when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood. 
Cultural relevance and responsiveness. Aspects of UDL. Digital rights and responsibilities. Adapting teaching and tasks around pupils interests (e.g. Earsketch, Minecraft coding)
 6. Pupils are motivated by intrinsic factors (related to their identity and values) and extrinsic factors (related to reward).
School reward systems. Engagement in online communities - safety and responsibility. Skills and opportunities as content creators.
7. Pupils’ investment in learning is also driven by their prior experiences and perceptions of success and failure. 
Broadening horizons. Career opportunities in computing. Careers in which computing is used. Computing and leisure - social media / gaming. 
TS8 Fulfil wider professional responsibilities


1. Effective professional development is likely to be sustained over time, involve expert support or coaching and opportunities for collaboration. 
CPD opportunities in computing. Developing subject knowledge. NCCE courses. Involvement in CAS. BCS membership.
 2. Reflective practice, supported by feedback from and observation of experienced colleagues, professional debate, and learning from educational research, is also likely to support improvement. 
Linking lesson / curriculum planning to software development methods - agile teaching; teaching as craft. Apprenticeship Patterns (Hoover and Oshineye)
 3. Teachers can make valuable contributions to the wider life of the school in a broad range of ways, including by supporting and developing effective professional relationships with colleagues. 
Whole school issues - ed tech; online safety; data; smart phones.
 4. Building effective relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success. 
Ways of sharing work. Drawing on parents’ expertise.
 5. Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers. 
Briefing TAs. Developing TAs’ technical and subject knowledge. 
6. SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils. 
Use of technology to support pupils with SEN/EAL. Relationships with network managers and technicians.
 7. Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve. 
Planning for ECT and beyond. NCCE courses. Online courses for subject knowledge. Engaging in the work of CAS / BCS.
