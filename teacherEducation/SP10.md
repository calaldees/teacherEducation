* Mentor WB 27th Nov
    * Consider how different forms of assessment (e.g. [[bebras]], EU Digital Competency Framework, Past exam papers, peer marking guidance) form a wider picture of progression in Computing.
        * What is an effective assessment?
        * How is this tracked across KS3/KS4/KS5 in your school?

        * How should data be used in the pupil progress evidence bundles?
            * Can an external reviewer of your ePortfolio see that every lesson you are collecting data in some form and then actioning that in your planning? How can you make this more explicit to an external?
    * How is group/pair work structured to enable all students to progress?
        * and what does that progress look like?

* Weekley Mentor Meeting
    * Mentor led foci - 21st November
        * Where do many of the subject misconceptions originate? How can you anticipate them?
        * How are misconceptions used positively in learning in subject department? What effective strategies are being used?
    * Mentor led foci - 28st November
        * Exploration of formal assessment processes and exam board specifications - What is an effective assessment?
        * How is assessment integrated into the department? How do we use the data gathered?
        * How should data be used in the pupil progress evidence bundles?

* Overview in spec
    * Formative assessment to inform planning and teaching in subject
    * Sequencing and structuring learning in subject

* Overview Today
    * Subject Pedagogy - Module Evaluation (15min)
    * Guest Speaker (1 hour)
        * Tommy - Computer Science Stand-up Comedian, Lecturer and AI Master Student at Kent
    * [[assessment_markscheme]] 1.5 hours
    * [[automated_tests]] 1 hour
    * [[pairProgramming]] 1 hour
        * Following 'Formative Assessment' -> Activating students as participants of their own learning

* The biggest Misconception
    * Using Google and as "Answer engine" not a "Search engine"
        * They are not the answers
