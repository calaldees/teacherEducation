I was asked for advice on setting up a hackathon for girls with local schools and undergrads.

* Routes
    * Creative route
        * Demosceene Font greets
        * Demogroup Team
    * Meaningful comunity engagment (solving a real problem)
        * office for national statistics
        * canterbury council data?
        * kent council data?

* Has to have meaningful output
    * Not just ducktaping cardboard together or making a mockup from powerpoint slides
* Need time to produce that meaninful output
    * Overnight
    * Social - food pizzas - present on Sunday lunchtime

* Prerequasit skills
    * Never processed data before, never created a dynamic webpage, never ...
    * Demo
        * Heatmap on maps
        * Google sheets for storage
* Attendees need to know what the event is and have the concepts modled/explained
    * Picking young people and expecting them to perform is foolish
    * They need to see the output of a real hack day to see what's possible and whats expected
    * The reason why people applaude and clap is because its genuinly impresive what peopole can do in 24 hours
    * Have a local comunity of people building projects (barcamp)
    * going from zero to hack day is not possible
* Careful not to demoralise
    * coding is hard - "anyone can code" is bullshit. If you open up a hack day for everyone you could just demoralise the weak attendees
    * ICT club for girls in 2004 was just an embarsement - purple spreadsheets about ponys. 
    * You can have good intentions and have an inverse effect

Anyone that thinks "just run a hack day" is going to have a disapointing event and even put people off
