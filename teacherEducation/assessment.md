ITT Core Framework
6.1
> Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs
6.2
> Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear
6.4
> pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect
6.5
> High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve
6.6
> Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.

Teachers' Standards
6 - Make accurate and productive use of assessment  
* know and understand how to assess the relevant subject and curriculum areas, including statutory assessment requirements  
* make use of formative and summative assessment to secure pupils’ progress
* use relevant data to monitor progress, set targets, and plan subsequent lessons  
* give pupils regular feedback, both orally and through accurate marking, and encourage pupils to respond to the feedback.

Introduction - Core Formative assessment principles
------------

* EEF [Teacher Feedback to Improve Pupil Learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/feedback/) 2018 - Six recommendations for using teacher feedback to improve pupil learning
    1. SET EXPECTATIONS: Lay the foundations for effective feedback
    2. TIMELY: Deliver appropriately timed feedback that focuses on moving learning forward
    3. PLAN TO USE: Plan for how pupils will receive and use feedback
    4. WRITTEN: Carefully consider how to use purposeful, and time-efficient, written feedback
    5. VERBAL: Carefully consider how to use purposeful verbal feedback
* [EEF Project: Embedding Formative Assessment](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and-evaluation/projects/embedding-formative-assessment/) Trial 2018
    * Local teaching groups asked to have a range of collaborative sessions address these 5 key points
        1. clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions
        2. engineering effective classroom discussions and activities
        3. providing feedback that moves learning forward
        4. activating learners as instructional resources for one another
        5. activating learners as owners of their own learning
    1. CONSISTENT: Design a school feedback policy that prioritises and exemplifies the principles of effective feedback

### Async (1hour)

* From the video answer the following questions (15min)
    * [Dylan Wiliam: What do we mean by Assessment for Learning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-myBw36_DA) 9min 2018
        * can you elaborate on _students as owners of their own learning_?
        * can you elaborate on _students are learning resources for one another_
        * What does Dylan mean when he says _view from the rear view mirror_?
        * What is the maximum number of times you should perform formative assessment?
* Read this influential paper - (30min reading + 15min notes and thinking about questions)

    * Questions for later in the session
        * How could we train pupils to self assess their work?
            * What skills, support, time, resources would they need to do this?
        * How do we give feedback?
            * what are the benefits/problems of verbal, written, digital?
        * How will students convey their understanding to you?
        * Can you give examples of feedback (phrases/sentences) that would prompt a student to improve? (we will look as group to see if we can wordsmith these)
        * How would you set regular homework + give meaningly feedback (timely) + observe that the feedback was actioned/had-impact

TASK 2: (25min) Discuss each question - (This will set the stage for some exploration this session)





### Deference of Formative Assessment and AfL

* [Formative assessment, assessment for learning, and all that jazz](https://www.schooleducationgateway.eu/en/pub/viewpoints/experts/formative-assessment-learning.htm) SchoolEducationGateway.eu 2020
    * Assessment for learning (the purpose of the assessment is to promote learning)
        * is any use of assessment that is primarily intended to improve, rather than measure, learning. 
        * If I tell my students on Monday that there is going to be a test on Friday, and the students study for the test, then the assessment is likely to improve the students’ learning, even if I do not actually give the test on Friday. 
        * Testing can also be highly effective as a study technique: as literally hundreds of psychological experiments have shown, taking a test improves learning even if the test is not scored, because it provides practice in retrieving items from memory, which is known to improve long-term learning.
    * Formative Assessment (the results of the assessment need to be used to improve instruction)
        * An assessment functions formatively to the extent that evidence from the assessment is used – by teachers, by students, or by their peers – to make better decisions about the next steps in instruction.
    * ... “formative” and “summative” ... (are)... different kinds of conclusions that might be drawn from assessment outcomes

* 'Formative assessment' should have been called 'responsive teaching' - 'assessment' makes people think of tests

* Lesson planning is about what you want them to learn, not what you want them to do
* AfL needs to be established and embedded
* AfL is only good if you use it to inform practice - this may mean 'changing the plan'

* Async - Read (10min)
    * [EEF Project: Embedding Formative Assessment](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and-evaluation/projects/embedding-formative-assessment/) EEFTrial 2018
    * What are the 5 key formative assessment strategies suggested by this trial (read the _Full Project Description_; it's hidden!!)
        * We will be working on our own strategies for these points in the session
    * TLC agendas and materials focused on five key formative assessment strategies: 
        * clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions
        * engineering effective classroom  discussions and activities
        * providing  feedback - that  moves  learning  forward
        * activating learners as instructional resources for one another
        * activating learners as owners of their own learning 
    * > Within each of these high-level  concepts, the TLC handouts introduced  multiple formative assessment techniques for teachers to consider

* > The additional progress made by children in the lowest third for prior attainment was greater than that made by children in the highest third.
* > The process evaluation indicated it may take more time for improvements in teaching practices and pupil learning strategies to feed fully into pupil attainment. Many teachers thought that younger students were more receptive to the intervention than their older and more exam-minded peers.

TASK:
* Create a heading in the GoogleDoc for each of the 5 areas
* In pairs take two headings (tutor to assign gruops)
* Think about that heading and add some notes to the GoogleDoc (20min)
* Summary as group (15min)

### "Assessment Literacy"
* Students have to see the value in the assessment
* Students need to know what each of the assessment types are for (summative/formative)
    * Some students don't see the point in formative assessment (only look at the grade)
    * Some students don't see the point in summative assessment (only care about personal progress and little for the course direction)
    * Some think they know the content already
* Feedback prior to summative assessment is vital

### Bias
* Assessments are a social construct
    * There is bias involved
        * What we think students _deserve_ (antonymous marking is better but sometimes not possible)
    * They are not an exact science

Carless (2015, p.192) defnes feedback as:
> A dialogic process in which learners make sense of information from varied sources and use it to enhance the quality of their work or learning strategies
Feedback also allows us to align with other practioners
Is everything we feedback on accurate, true, relevent, important - do we talk a lot of shit?
Student don't know what feedback is - so you now need to 'cookie message the shit out of this' "This is Feedback: ....". In emails, in conversations
When students are given feedback - most of them don't understand - get them to reciprocate with their intended actions and why

Good Feedback
1. Timely
2. Facilitates self-assessment
3. Delivers high quality information to students about their learning
4. Encourages teacher and peer dialogue
5. Encourages positivity and self-esteem
6. Helps close the gap between current and desired performance
7. Provides valuable information to teachers

    * > Student feedback is a contentious and confusing issue throughout higher education institutions. This paper develops and analyses two models of feedback: 
        * > the first is based on the origins of the term in the disciplines of engineering and biology. It positions teachers as the drivers of feedback. 
        * > The second draws on ideas of sustainable assessment. This positions learners as having a key role in driving learning, and thus generating and soliciting their own feedback. It suggests that the second model equips students beyond the immediate task and does not lead to false expectations that courses cannot deliver.
    * Curriculum design
    * Time-on-task, the most thoroughly documented contributor to student achievement (Hattie 2009)
    * > there needs to be a way of detecting that there has been an effect in the direction desired. The cycle of feedback needs to be completed. If there is no discernable effect, then feedback has not occurred.
    * Sadler (1989, 78) to identify three conditions for effective feedback: 
        * (1) student knowledge of the standards that needs to be applied; 
        * (2) having to compare those standards to the students’ own work and 
        * (3) the student taking action to close the gap between the two. 
        * The second and third conditions both require the student to actively engage with the feedback.
    * four characteristics of sustainable feedback:
        1. involving students in dialogues about learning which raise their awareness of quality performance;
        2. facilitating feedback processes through which students are stimulated to develop capacities in monitoring and evaluating their own learning;
        3. enhancing student capacities for ongoing lifelong learning by supporting student development of skills for goal setting and planning their learning and
        4. designing assessment tasks to facilitate student engagement over time in which feedback from varied sources is generated, processed and used to enhance performance on multiple stages of assignments
    * > The sustainable notion of feedback fits well with Barnett and Coate’s (2005) view of the curriculum in higher education as deliberately designed to engage students, among others. They write of
      >> the imaginative design of spaces as such, spaces that are likely to generate new energies among students and inspire them, and so prompt their triple engagement – in knowing, acting and being. (3) [their italics]
      > Barnett and Coate are sceptical of ‘curricula rules and templates’ and of specifying ‘in advance the elements of every programme of study’ (2005, 3). We see the suggestions for feedback here as illustrations of many ways in which the ideas they contain can be manifested, not as the only ways in which they could or should be manifested.
    * It is only through taking a curriculum perspective, which is broader than a learning view or an assessment view, that feedback can be adequately located. Such a view enables feedback to be repositioned away from its taken for granted role as a feature of the ways teachers act towards students, towards being seen as an attribute of the curriculum that locates it as a central feature of student engagement. Feedback becomes therefore a key curriculum space for communicating, for knowing, for judging and for acting. It is not something that teachers do, any more than it is something students do: it is a necessary characteristic of any given curriculum, the effectiveness of which is a key indicator of the effectiveness of the whole course of study.

    * > the greatest predictor of enhanced student marks (on the assessment task that was the subject of the experiment), was the development of their ability to judge standards of performance on student work created in response to a similar task. The intervention took just 50 minutes indicating a good educational return on the pedagogical investment.
    * > creating an emphasis on a meta-dialogue about assessment, its purposes and how it functions. A further implication is that gains typically attributable to formative feedback could be enhanced not by a more detailed explication of the feedback by lecturers but rather by deploying assessment literacy (judgement)-enhancing protocols at the formative feedback points during the semester.
    * > Although the gains in student marks were modest in this case, the intervention was extremely brief, just 50 minutes. It is the potential leverage of the development of the ability to judge standards that makes it worthwhile considering incorporating these kinds of assessment literacy-developing protocol into regular teaching practice. In this study the gain was a 10% increase in the marks (approximately 2 in 20) on the task to which the protocol applied.

Visible Curriculum - The Education Machine (A historical syndical lens)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why are you here?
[Teachers' Standards](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/665522/Teachers_standard_information.pdf)

* Help mould young people to be lifelong learners, passionate, self worth, collaborative, community driven human beings

* Can't rely on teachers opinion - no standardisation
* Baseline for comparison across departments/schools/county's
* Evidence based rather than opinion based

* You observe the students - you already know - you know them - you work with 1000's of kids with years of experience. You know. But you need evidence.

* IQ of 86 - Minimum bar for military
    * Under this number there is not a single task that can be given to the individual that is not counter productive.
    * 10% of the population

* Governments 'Value added': +/- from predicted attainment
    * Take Sats (english/maths) estimate IQ
    * Take entire country's GCSE results.
    * Derive average expected GCSE attainment (year 11) from sats (year 7)
    * Apply this derived heuristic to next years cohort (or loosely any future cohort at any yeargroup stage)
* All teachers/departments are ranked in every school.
    * Whether you're told or not; you are ranked.
    * Take a single student
    * Average all their other GCSE's
    * Compare their GCSE average against your subjects attainment +/-
    * Sort the list

* When dealing with averages on this scale, no excuse matters
    * One student had XYZ so they attained poorly. Well averages state another student did better than expected. The world is even. The excuse that a whole class is 'rotten' doesn't hold up against the averages. The weak link is you.

* Schools want this standardised assessment
* Parents want this standardised assessment
* Government's want this standardised assessment

* Teachers in different schools suffer different burdens
    * Ghrama school teachers stating their two level 4's are shameful (one was a school refuser, one had learning difficulty's. The result is still abounding!)
    * Comprehensive school teachers would be overjoyed at 38% of a class attaining level 4

* Cambels law - Any system with a measurable metric is gamed.
* Anything that you do that is not directly related to GCSE metrics (or open evening perception) is pointless.
* SMT Don't know or care.
* If you're _nice_ but don't produce results you'll be seen as a weak practitioner.

* Cash cash cash
    * A-Level class
    * 16 students
    * All predicted E's (because you cant be preicted U's because there is no point in sitting the course)
        * Most students only got 4 GCSE's (in ICT that was 100% coursework), so they take ICT A-Level or Computing A-Level as it' the only foundation skill on paper they have competence in.
    * If they are all predicted U's is this the best choice for this student?
    * Who care's if it's good for the student; every bum on a seat is raw cash baby!!!

* Education is a business
* Welcome to the factory

Every Teacher knows the system is not sufficient - let's not re-enforce that - let's find solutions

Many people have advised governments against this and opinion/process is positively changing
David Didau and Dylan Wiliam + MANY more are inspiring national change


Invisible Curriculum - Character Traits
---------------------------------------

* Draw a picture of a horse as accurately as possible - you will be marked on proportions, feature accuracy, detail - show publicly (5 min)
* Outside (change lesson)
* Write a 3 line poem about Computing. You have (5 min)

Imagine being placed under somebody else's control every 60 minuets and asked to do something that you can't do and then display it publicly and constantly compare you to your peers.

Activity: Why are you here? (Refer to the teacher standards)

* "Everybody is a genius but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live the rest of it's whole life thinking it's stupid" (Albert Einstein)
* "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self" (Anthony Moore)
* Ken Robinson's Story - Mary - Year 3 - Cold breaktime - drawing God - 'nobody knows what god looks like' - 'they will in a minuet miss' - then the lesson starts, robbed of that freedom.

* The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is ok as far as it goes.
* The second step is to disregard that which can't be measured or give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading.
* The third step is to presume that what can't be measured easily really isn't very important. This is blindness.
* The forth step is to say that that which can't be easily measured really doesn't exist.
(Blatchford 2014)

ITT Core Framework
6.4
> pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect
6.5
> High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve
6.6
> Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.


#### Assessment Criteria -> Peer/Self Assessment

Activity: "Pupils a can identify a range of web page design features and can explain why the designer has chosen to use them for the target audience"

Publish your assessment criteria
Show examples of good/bad work
They now know + can peer self assess

You see 300+ students a week - you dont have a chance of marking it

Advantages of peer assessment
* stepping stone for self assessment
* less threatening than teacher
* more honest (brutal)
* language more relatable
* more likely to interrupt rather than continue listening to teacher
* different approach angle than teacher


#### Questioning Techniques

Questioning is a form of assessment.

hands up
targeted
pair share
  snowball
round robin
expert groups
Jigsaw (different groups, different questions)
individual whiteboards
Opinion line

Questioning 1-to-1 to assess understanding

Question to diagnose

    * OCR Project tracking sheet

* Transparency - Available to everyone? - Data protection
* See who's falling behind
* Setting targets
* Tracking should be available to you, students, department - How?

* Students should have a habit of evidence gathering - the process is more important than the outcome

* Dictaphone? - how to archive/store? catalog? transcribe?

Activity:
* What data will you track for a class?
* How often?
* How will this data help
    * you? (accountability)
    * students?
    * department?
* How will you track it?
    * Spreadsheet
    * SIM's Software (ubertrack for smt impractical for everyday use)

Lambert and Lines (2000) describe how teachers fall into an 'Accountability Trap' where they see there own tracking systems as being used to 'prove' their competence.


### 'Cover your ass' case study

* Every practical focused A-Level lesson. Sat one-to-one with student. These are the deadlines you've missed. These are the attainments of your current work. Conversation recorded in database. Key points for improvement. New deadlines for missing work. weekley log of everything agreed with student. They know they have work that is 3 weeks late a letter will be sent home.
* Near end of year a student realised they were really really really behind. Made a sob story about how they were not supported properly and it was the school/teachers fault. Parent goes on warpath. Calls meeting with Head of 6th form and Head of Department and Teacher. Parent ready for a fight. Teacher puts down 5 sheets of A4 with every conversation with the student over the year documented. Multiple letters sent home that 'never got there'. Student frog marched out of room.
* NO Student. However good your rapport with, is your friend. They will turn on you. Your department will turn on you. The only defence you will ever have is assessment evidence and records. They are your lifeline. ALWAYS keep good records.
