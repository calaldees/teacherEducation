How to observe a lesson
=======================

* QUESTION: Why would you observe a lesson - what is the purpose?

---


* "General Observations" are NOT effective
    * To much is happening to lead to meaningful observations -> meaningful conclusions -> meaningful impact/manifestation in your teaching
* Every observation should have
    * The _Focus_
    * _Why_ have you chosen this focus
    * _Future actions_ (either on observation or in weekley reflections - signpost this in either direction for an external examiner)
* Do not just write a list of 'descriptions' of what happened with timestamps.
* Reflective model
    * What -> So What -> Now What
    * The 'Why' is all important


* Possible focus ideas
    * Transitions
        * How does the teacher move between different activities and how is this co-ordinated
        * How many segments are their in lessons?
    * Use of language
        * Technical/subject?
            * Do they highlight key vocabulary/language?
        * How do they relate to the students
        * Use of voice (to class, to individuals)
        * What % of the time are students using computers? Is this different from different year groups?
    * Non verbal communication
        * Position in room
        * Use of hands, face, gestures
    * What is the "Behaviour for learning environment", how is this constructed
    * Shadow/focus on 2 different pupils (selected from tracking before the lesson started)
    * Teacher time
        * Focus on tracking how much time the teacher spends on each action
    * How is prior learning identified/used?
    * Linking this lessons content to wider SOW
    * Identifying explicit CompSci/ICT/DigitalLiteracy
    * How is technology used by the teacher and students
    * What routines are in place
        * Why were these created? How do they assist learning
    * What wall displays are in place - are they actively used in lessons?
    * What % of time are TeacherTalking, StudentsCollaborating, StudentsIndependent

TASK:
Using 

1. Curriculum CTP Guidelines (Mentor Journal WB xxx)
2. All Documents -> Observing Experts examples
3. My List above
4. Your own interests/focus

Compile a list of questions/tasks/items that could focus your observations in your first week.
(By "you" creating this list, you will have taken ownership of development and this will hopefully have more impact/relevance)
