* Mentor led foci 
    * What are the key barriers to learning in this curriculum area and how are those barriers addressed and overcome?
    * What key strategies are used in department and school? What relevant policies in school and department?
    * How do teachers relate to pupils to support positive behaviour for learning?
    * How is the department’s behaviour for learning policy implemented to aid learning? What effective strategies have been observed?

--------

* Planning to aid learning in subject; making effective use of a lesson plan
* Planning for progression - Schemes of Work - Building schemata
    * Pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models
* concrete and abstract examples
