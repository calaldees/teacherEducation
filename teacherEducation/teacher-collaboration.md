    * PCK by proxy
    * There is an unheard commentary that is a part of any shared lesson resource
        * You would normally have this by talking to the other teacher
    * Lesson resources are missing _pedagogical metadata_
    * _Why_ we do what we do
    * Pedagogical reasoning - Know how to:
        * Know what you need to be able to teach
        * Know how to find it
        * How to repurpose it
        * How to teach with it

    * > computing educators adopting a cycle of embracing existing literature when devising teaching practice and then feeding their experience and findings back to the community in a rigorous fashion.

    * > Microsoft 365 and Google Suite both provide productivity tools such as chat (instant messaging), internal websites, shared documents and the ability to collaborate on documents. All of these can be considered communication channels that have advantages over email. Train your staff to be confident with these tools and explain how they might be used to improve communications (and reduce email).

Collaboration Tools
-----

### Plain office documents

* Somewhat portable
* Understandable by most people
* Prone to corruption/dataloss
* Transmission
    * Email
    * Website (upload)
    * Dropbox
        * Versions (for 2 weeks)

Problems
* No change log
* Contributing changes back to the author is hard/manual/complex/time-consuming
* fragmented (people have different versions) that are inaccessible from the original
* Difficult to search content (searching for text inside an individual slide of a sideshow)
* Struggle to meet legal accessibility standards
* Data is locked in formats of propriety software


### Cloud Based Office Documents

* Single point of truth always accessible
* Multiple editors
* Comments system

Problems
* Anyone can change anything at anytime
    * Someone could just remove chunks of information you consider important or still need
* Limited log of changes
* Difficult to search text deep in documents
* 3rd Party tech companies control your data


### Version control (with text representation)

* Point of truth always accessible
* Multiple editors
* Contributions go through a review/consultation process
* Every previous version is tracked and accessible
* Content is searchable
* Meets legal accessibility standards

Problems
* Learning curve to make contributions
