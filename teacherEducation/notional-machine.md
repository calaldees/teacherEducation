    * > Without an appropriate mental model of a notional machine, it is considered that student knowledge of the programming process and processing languages is “fragile” (Perkins, Schwartz, & Simmons, Reference Perkins, Schwartz, Simmons and Meyer1990) and that challenges faced by novices in learning to program are frequently due to their mental model of the notional machine being “inadequate” (Smith & Webb, Reference Smith and Webb1995). 
    * > Without making the notional machine explicit in our learning processes, we risk students forming incomplete or conflicting mental models that are littered with misconceptions and often informed by guesswork.
