    * > "a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something without which the learner cannot progress" Meyer 2003
    1. Portability: A threshold concept should be relevant to two or more topic areas within the subject
    2. Buildability: threshold concept should be revisited from a teaching and learning perspective several times across different ages and stages of learning
    * some thoughts about ICT and DL concepts
        * Grouping
        * Layers
        * Styles

    * > These conceptual gateways are integrative, exposing the previously hidden interrelatedness of ideas, and are irreversible.
      > However they frequently present troublesome knowledge and are often points at which students become stuck.
      > Difficulty in understanding may leave the learner in a 'liminal' state of transition, a 'betwixt and between' space of knowing and not knowing, where understanding can approximate to a form of mimicry.
      > Learners navigating such spaces report a sense of uncertainty, ambiguity, paradox, anxiety, even chaos
* Forgetting is normal - Liminal space is normal - reassure them it is normal
* Don't rush to students to 'make it right' let them grapple with the problem

* Example
    * programming constructs
        * If statements
        * Iteration
        * Variables
        * Functions and parameters
    * Once we understand those threshold concepts, we can move on to 
        * "Algorithms"
    * Once we understand there are different algorithms to solve the same problem we can 
        * deliberate which may be the most appropriate and why

TASK: Build a tree of knowledge for computing, what are some of the threshold concept that unlock other skills? Include ICT and DL.
