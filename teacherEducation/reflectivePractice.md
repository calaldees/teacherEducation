Reflective practice
===================

* Up until now, (level 6 and below) you have been _taught at_. You've been told what to learn and how to learn it.
* At postgraduate level - there are 'no answers'.
* We have take information from a range of sources and structure our thinking in a particular way that allows us to critically inspect and challenges our beliefs/assumptions

"I'm just going to think lots and get better" - not that simple
