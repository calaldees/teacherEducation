SQ 7: What does ‘inclusion’ really mean?
-----------------------------------------

Understanding inclusion and the key strategies that create and hinder an inclusive classroom

* Learning Objectives
    * Understand the relationship between inclusion and differentiation
    * Identify and understand all the different factors that affect or prevent students’ learning and progress
    * Plan for inclusive learning using research and best practice; responding to and meeting the needs of all learners

### Reading
* GP5: Davis, P.. (2004) [Teaching Strategies and Approaches for Pupils with Special Educational Needs: A Scoping Study](http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/id/eprint/6059)
    * > separate special education pedagogy are unhelpful given the current policy context, and that the more important agenda is about how to develop a pedagogy that is inclusive of all learners
    * > understand how combinations of teaching approaches might be used in different contexts and for different purposes

KSQ 7: What does ‘inclusion’ really mean?
Understanding inclusion and the key strategies that create and hinder an inclusive classroom
* Learning Objectives
    * Understand the relationship between inclusion and differentiation
    * Identify and understand all the different factors that affect or prevent students’ learning and progress
    * Plan for inclusive learning using research and best practice; responding to and meeting the needs of all learners

NOTE1: A drawback of 'current' world of teaching - to reduce workload planning you are expected to be given largely pre-constructed lessons. This limits your ability to develop planning skills.
NOTE2: Topic is HUGE. This session will scratch the surface.
