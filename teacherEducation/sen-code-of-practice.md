SEND code of practice
---------------------

* Some of my remarks
    * Many of the special schools have been closed - a wider spectrum of students are expected to attend mainstream education.
    * Every teacher is a teacher of SEN and disabilities - we do not delegate to other teachers - we ARE the support
    * We are an inclusive society


* 9 million children in eduction
    * SEN 1.4 million
    * Support plan 0.3 million
    * Special school 0.13 million

* [SEND code of practice: 0 to 25 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25)
    * 1.24, 1.26
    * Pretty much all of section 6 (weighted towards the earlier points)

TASK 2: (15min)
PartA:
* What are the 4 broad areas of need - can you identify any traits/names to these areas?
PartB (15min - could be extended ...)
* What could we do in a Computing classroom to facilitate each of these possible traits/areas of need?
    * Would love to hear your personal experiences and contributions


TASK 1: (15min)
* What are your responsibilities as a subject teacher?
    * Shared Doc
* A list of skills/training-needs you think you need to develop (You will use this list in your mentor meetings)

<summary>(Hidden) My Notes</summary>

* 1.24
    * High quality teaching that is differentiated and personalised will meet the individual needs of the majority of children and young people.
    * Some children and young people need educational provision that is additional to or different from this.
    * This is special educational provision under Section 21 of the Children and Families Act 2014.
    * Schools and colleges must use their best endeavours to ensure that such provision is made for those who need it.
    * Special educational provision is underpinned by high quality teaching and is compromised by anything less.
* 1.26
    * As part of its commitments under articles 7 and 24 of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UK Government is committed to inclusive education of disabled children and young people and the progressive removal of barriers to learning and participation in mainstream education.
* Section 6: pg91 to pg110
* 6.2
    * ensure that children and young people with SEN engage in the activities of the school alongside pupils who do not have SEN
    * The quality of teaching for pupils with SEN, and the progress made by pupils, should be a core part of the school’s performance management arrangements and its approach to professional development for all teaching and support staff. School leaders and teaching staff, including the SENCO, should identify any patterns in the identification of SEN
    * The identification of SEN should be built into the overall approach to monitoring the progress and development of all pupils
* 6.12
    * All pupils should have access to a broad and balanced curriculum. 
    * The National Curriculum Inclusion Statement states that teachers should set high expectations for every pupil, whatever their prior attainment. 
    * Teachers should use appropriate assessment to set targets which are deliberately ambitious. 
    * Potential areas of difficulty should be identified and addressed at the outset. 
    * Lessons should be planned to address potential areas of difficulty and to remove barriers to pupil achievement. 
    * In many cases, such planning will mean that pupils with SEN and disabilities will be able to study the full national curriculum.
* 6.16
    * Schools should assess each pupil’s current skills and levels of attainment on entry, building on information from previous settings and key stages where appropriate
* 6.17
    * Class and subject teachers, supported by the senior leadership team, should make regular assessments of progress for all pupils. 
    * These should seek to identify pupils making less than expected progress given their age and individual circumstances
* 6.18
    * It can include progress in areas other than attainment – for instance where a pupil needs to make additional progress with wider development or social needs in order to make a successful transition to adult life
* 6.19
    * The first response to such progress should be high quality teaching targeted at their areas of weakness.
    * Where progress continues to be less than expected the class or subject teacher, working with the SENCO, should assess whether the child has SEN
* 6.21
    * Persistent disruptive or withdrawn behaviours do not necessarily mean that a child or young person has SEN. Where there are concerns, there should be an assessment to determine whether there are any causal factors such as undiagnosed learning difficulties, difficulties with communication or mental health issues. 
    * If it is thought housing, family or other domestic circumstances may be contributing to the presenting behaviour a multi-agency approach
* 6.22
    * Professionals should also be alert to other events that can lead to learning difficulties or wider mental health difficulties, such as bullying or bereavement.
    * Such events will not always lead to children having SEN but it can have an impact on wellbeing and sometimes this can be severe.
    * Schools should ensure they make appropriate provision for a child’s short-term needs in order to prevent problems escalating.
* 6.23
    * Slow progress and low attainment do not necessarily mean that a child has SEN and should not automatically lead to a pupil being recorded as having SEN. 
    * However, they may be an indicator of a range of learning difficulties or disabilities.
    * Equally, it should not be assumed that attainment in line with chronological age means that there is no learning difficulty or disability.
    * Some learning difficulties and disabilities occur across the range of cognitive ability and, left unaddressed may lead to frustration, which may manifest itself as disaffection, emotional or behavioural difficulties.
* 6.24
    * Identifying and assessing SEN for children or young people whose first language is not English requires particular care
* (6.28 -> 6.35) 4 areas of need
    * Communication / Interaction (6.28, 6.29)
        * Speech Language
        * Autism
        * Aspergers
    * Cognition (6.30, 6.31)
        * Learning difficulties
        * Specific learning difficulties
            * Dyslexic, Dispracsic
    * Social / Emotional (6.32, 6.33)
        * ADHD
        * Attachment Disorder
        * Self Harm
    * Sensory / Physical (6.34, 6.35)
        * Visual
        * Hearing
        * Physical
* 6.37
    * High quality teaching, differentiated for individual pupils, is the first step in responding to pupils who have or may have SEN.
    * Additional intervention and support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality teaching. 
    * Schools should regularly and carefully review the quality of teaching for all pupils, including those at risk of underachievement.
    * This includes reviewing and, where necessary, improving,teachers’ understanding of strategies to identify and support vulnerable pupils and their knowledge of the SEN most frequently encountered
* 6.45 Assess
    * ... subject teacher, working with the SENCO, should carry out a clear analysis of the pupil’s needs.
    * This should draw on the teacher’s assessment and experience of the pupil, their previous progress and attainment, as well as information from the school’s core approach to pupil progress, attainment, and behaviour.
    * It should also draw on other subject teachers’ assessments where relevant, the individual’s development in comparison to their peers and national data, the views and experience of parents, the pupil’s own views and, if relevant, advice from external support services.
    * Schools should take seriously any concerns raised by a parent.
    * These should be recorded and compared to the setting’s own assessment and information on how the pupil is developing.
* 6.49 Plan
    * All teachers and support staff who work with the pupil should be made aware of their needs, the outcomes sought, the support provided and any teaching strategies or approaches that are required. This should also be recorded on the school’s information system.
* 6.52 Do
    * subject teacher should remain responsible for working with the child on a daily basis. Where the interventions involve group or one-to-one teaching away from the main class or subject teacher, they should still retain responsibility for the pupil.
* 6.54 Review
    * The impact and quality of the support and interventions should be evaluated, along with the views of the pupil and their parents.
* 6.65
    * Where a pupil is receiving SEN support, schools should talk to parents regularly to set clear outcomes and review progress towards them
* 6.66
    * These discussions can build confidence in the actions being taken by the school, but they can also strengthen the impact of SEN support by increasing parental engagement in the approaches and teaching strategies that are being used
* 6.68
    * Conducting these discussions effectively involves a considerable amount of skill. As with other aspects of good teaching for pupils with SEN, schools should ensure that teaching staff are supported to manage these conversations as part of professional development.
