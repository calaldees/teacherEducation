Two fascinating reports are published today linked to Computing education and I'd love to hear your thoughts:

King's College London's Subject Choice, Attainment and Representation in Computing Project report (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ecs/assets/kcl-scari-computing.pdf) calls for:
✔️Curriculum reform for greater choice of KS4 Computing qualifications
✔️*All* students to leave school with the digital skills they need to thrive
✔️Full support to recruit and retain qualified teachers to make the computing curriculum accessible, relevant and engaging

The Pearson School Report (https://www.pearson.com/en-gb/schools/insights-and-events/topics/school-report/2024.html) summaries findings from over 12,000 teachers and students, showing that:
✔️ More than 6 in 10 students want a curriculum that better prepares them for a digital world (p52)
✔️ More than half of teachers say we need a better digital curriculum (p72)
✔️ More than 6 in 10 secondary students say they're not learning enough about AI (p74)
