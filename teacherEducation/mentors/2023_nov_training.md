Subject Mentor training â€“ November 2023 
=======================
 
* Below is an outline of the 1 hour session (3-4pm) with Subject Mentors on Friday 10th November 2023. 
* This has the potential to be extended to 1.5 hours during the virtual session on Monday 13th November. 
* The intention is not to have any specific slides showing, but to pull up/draw upon pages from the e-Portfolio where relevant. 
* Throughout there is a focus on the subject within the broader context of the areas being considered. 

A suggested order and content for the session is:
