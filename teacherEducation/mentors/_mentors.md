From Ofsted Reports - The Solent SCITT ​
> Mentors are regarded as good role models rather than trained to be experts. ​
> Mentors are not seen as, or trained to be, the expert colleagues the core content framework demands.

Mentor are expected as part of the ECF to use research readings.



Space to try things their own way and come to their own conclusions
Sometimes have to say hard things

* mentoring? -> coaching?
   * > coach has some some great questions for your answers
   * > mentor has some great answers for your questions
   * be specific as to which mode you are operating in

skilled in deconstructing and explaining their practice
outstanding teachers are not necessarily outstanding mentors
carter review 2014

concious competence == saying "mirror signal manurer"
unconcious incompitence == you just drive? really need to think about the steps

They may want to bury the failure - you must help them unpick it


co-observe a lesson - prompt the student with what to look for
oberve a sequence of lesson
observe (with a focus)


Meeting record done by the student - you sign it off each week
The weekly meeting is the most important moment of the week
Left hand side
 Review targets from previous week
 3 Targests for this week (there will be more, but whats most urgent)
    specific, mesurable, A, R, T
 eventually these targets will be pupil progress targets
 (support they need - not nessisrally mentor, point in right direction)
Right hand side is reflections
 how week, well, not well, why
 rolfs model - what _so what_ now what
 kolb reflection, theorising, expeimenting, experience (advanced)

If they have the same target every week this may be alarm bells

One formal observation each week
 * lesson plan (provided by student) on CCCU proforma (in advance? 24h?)
    * give them a focus for you observations (linked to targets from weekly meeting?)
 * your observations form - ask them 'how do you think it went?' - limit what you share, 2 or 3 prioritys
    * who was most engaged? who was not engaged?
 * evaluatiion (by student)
Move beyond _just descriptions_ - move towards analysis/evaluation _why_s

practical working documents - not perfect masterpeices

When they hit a low patch - go back through the older weekley meetings to show progress

observe other subjects

You are a pivotal character in their career
