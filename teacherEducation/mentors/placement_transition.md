   * [Mentor Website: 7min video + pdf pack](http://ccccumentors.org.uk/secondary/mentor-proformas.php)
* Placement 2 Transition
   * Placement 2 is _contrasting_. Placement 1 has been significantly disrupted. DfE know that next years NQT's will need additional support.
   * Contact beforehand?
      * Reading? Prep? to prepare for your school/environment/students?
      * Expectations (2 way? How will mentor meetings work)
      * Share MPR2
   * Spotlight questions for this placement (ideal world?)
      1. What is a broad and balanced Curriculum?
         * Developing the whole student; considering subject inter-connections and cross-curricula learning.
      2. How do you lead learning?
         * Developing classroom practice to become an autonomous practitioner who has an impact on learners, learning and progress.
      3.  What is my impact?
         * Evaluating impact on pupil learning, progress and development of professional identity
   * Activities
      * Tour school (shadow staff or pupil)? 
      * Inspect SOW?
      * Emphasis on assessment for learning (most of their experience has been online and they may not have strategies for this)
      * Subject knowledge (get them to run a revision session?)
* Assessment check-in
   * [Mentor Guidance for New Assessment.docx](http://ccccumentors.org.uk/files/secondary/Documentation/assessment/Mentor%20Guidance%20for%20New%20Assessment.docx)
   * Are people conformable with the _Key Questions_ and _grade codification_?
* Pair mentors together in breakout rooms to discuss students (from->to) (timebox 30min max? two 15min chunks)
   * Subject Tutor to co-ordinate
   * Mentors can move between rooms autonomously
