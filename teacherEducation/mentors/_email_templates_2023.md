Subject: Computing Subject Mentor - Introductions

Hi  (Computing Subject Mentor - XXXSchool)
(cc'ing as part of process
  Trainee Teacher - xxx School,
  Professional Mentor - xx School,
  Tanya Barwick (Lead Mentor - CCCU),
)

I am the subject pedagogy tutor from Canterbury Christ Church University for Computing. 
I want to extend a warm welcome to you as new mentor to our programme.
I look forward to getting to know you and your school over the next few months.

I was delighted to meet XXXX last Friday (22nd September). He was enthusiastic about the year to come.

I want to thank you for the work that you have undertaken so far with XXXX.
This initial period of Induction is always important to help them settle into their new school. 

Whilst I appreciate that this might appear to be quite a long email, what I have tried to do here is to pull together the main points that will help you in supporting your student as they set out on their journey towards gaining QTS.

We will be using Microsoft OneNote as a single repository to hold all of the course documentation and chronicle your students progress.
Below is a link to a OneNote Notebook for "All Documents for School Direct Computing":
https://cccu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/sm1161_canterbury_ac_uk/Eg339CoktNZOsWIF9RQyu8ABPb1axqBqnpVzEfds_9a5cQ
(The documents I refer to throughout this document are available in the OneNote link above)

I am aware the amount of documentation may initially feel overwhelming, but I hope with the support from XXXX as your professional mentor, my support with school visits and our mentor training sessions, that you will be well supported with your role as a mentor.

I want to draw your attention to a few key items:

--- Teaching % Time
The School Direct Handbook can be found at
OneNote -> Course Information -> School Direct Guide 2023 (Course Handbook)
On Page 27 of the handbook reminds you of the structure for their teaching timetable and how this increases steadily over the course of the year so as not to overload students. Just as a reminder, we do not expect the students to be undertaking any solo teaching at the early part of the year.

--- Weekly Mentor Meeting
Thank you for the time that you will be giving over to the dedicated weekly meeting. 
We all know that the quality of this meeting time is key to the success of the student. 
The student has access to a OneNote->“Mentor Meeting Journal” that should be completed as part of each meeting. 
This sits inside their ePortfolio and more information about this is given below. 
This includes the setting of weekly targets and the review of progress against them.

--- Computing Curriculum Guidance
A copy of the Curriculum Guidance document for Computing for this year is available at
OneNote -> Course Information -> Computing Curriculum Guidance 2023  
This sets out, in detail, the ITE curriculum that is to be delivered jointly and in partnership between the training school and the university. 
Students will be briefed this week on how this is to be used, but in essence, this document sets out what we expect subject mentors to be discussing with their students in the weekly meeting. (The contents of this are mirrored in OneNote -> Weekly Meeting Journal)
This was explained in more detail in the recent training event for School Direct Subject Mentors.

-- Lesson Observations
Formal lesson observations of your trainee should ideally be undertaken once a week, but can be completed by you or by other members of your Computing department. 
A copy of the university observation form is available at:
OneNote -> Formal Lesson Observations -> Formal Feedback Template for lesson
I would recommend is used to capture all observations to avoid the distinction between formal and informal observations. 
Students need to gather a minimum of 20 lesson observations by the end of the programme, so I would suggest you aim for one per week once the student starts to teach. 
Once discussed, students should upload a copy of the completed observation forms to their ePortfolio (see below).

--- School Visit
Later in the term I will be in touch about setting up a time to come into school to meet with you to review and support the mentoring process.
More information about this will follow in due course, but please be aware that as part of the course, all students and mentors are entitled to two school visits (plus the final assessment).
I will be in touch with more details about this in due course, but for the moment, please be aware that I would like to undertake this first visit before the start of December.  

--- The ePortfolio
The ePortfolio is the repository for all the programme documents that students need to collect over the course of the year. 
Students can upload documents and write to this, mentors only have “read only access” to this document 
Student teachers are expected to use their e-portfolio as their essential working space, including to plan lessons, to complete their mentor meeting journal, to set their weekly targets and to reflect on observing other’s lessons. 
Other sections may be added over the course of the year.

You can access XXXX’s OneNote ePortfolio here:

This is a "Read Only" link for you as a mentor
(Please get back to me if you hit a problem with this link)

--- Contacting me
I see my role as being one of assisting you in helping your student teacher to reach their full potential over the course of the year. 
I also believe in open channels of communication, so if you should need to contact me on any issue regarding either the placement requirements or the progress of your student teacher, please do so by:

It would be good to have a 15min "Early Impressions" remote video call with you over the next couple of weeks to see how XXX is settling in and to answer any questions of yours. Please use the booking system link above to select a time that is continent for you.

I am very grateful for your assistance in helping to train our next generation of outstanding teachers in Computing and I look forward to working with you over the course of the year.

Kind regards,

Early Impressions

Subject: Mentor Early Impressions Conversation and School Visit


Hi xxx (Computing Subject Mentor)
(cc'ing 
  xx (Professional Mentor) as part of process,
  xxx as Student Teacher
)

Thank you for supporting xxx with his first few weeks of placement.

Now that the intense period of induction sessions has finished, my next priority is to connect with mentors.

1.) 
I'm required to have a 15min MSTeams remote meeting with mentors within the first few weeks of placement to check on initial progress.
I'm interested in how XXX has settled in but I'm also interested to ensure you are supported in your mentoring.
Could you book a 15min call with me next week using my booking system link below.

https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/3e0385ef8fb340e38b6686624a78dda0@canterbury.ac.uk?anonymous&ep=pcard

2.) 
We need to organise a 2 hour visit to your school over the next couple of months (before December).
Although I am interested in xxx's progress, visits are 'Mentor facing' to support the mentoring process.
During the visit we can spend some focused time discussing mentoring techniques and the university curriculum.
We should also take part in a joint mentoring activity. (This could be performing a segment of a weekly mentor meeting together.)
It would also be beneficial to me to see xxx teach, but this is not a requirement of my visit.
Again; you can use the booking system to see my availability and arrange a full 2 hour visit.
(If you require any dates/times that are not listed on the booking system please contact me and I can move some existing meetings to meet your availability)

If there are any questions in the meantime please feel free to email me.

xxx has made an excellent start to the year and engaging in university subject sessions with gusto.

I'm looking forward to working with you this year.

I'm required to visit 

•	Has the student settled into school/department routines? 
•	Are they showing initiative?  
•	How is their professionalism including attendance and punctuality?
•	Working relationships – are they building these? 
•	Observations of experts - is this happening?
•	Working with whole class/Collaborative Teaching Phase – are they still in the CTP? What have they been doing as a part of this?
•	Development needs of student – what are they?
•	Subject knowledge/curriculum needs – how is their subject knowledge developing? 
•	Are they proactive and open to mentoring?
•	Are their fundamental skills (e.g. literacy and numeracy) proficient? 
•	What are the student’s strengths? 
•	Where are mentors in their training? What is your experience as a mentor?


Visit Prompt
------------

Computing Mentor Visit - Arranging a date?

Hi,
  xxx (as Computing Subject Mentor), 
  xxx (as Professional Mentor),
  xxx (as trainee teacher)


xxx

As part of process, I should visit schools once per placement.
I would like to extend the offer to visit your school and support your mentoring.
This visit can be before or after Christmas. My hope is that an earlier visit will lead to more impact.

A mentor visit normally looks something like:
 - 45min xxx and Allan - Discuss curriculum and progress 
 - 45min xxx,xxx and Allan - A normal mentoring activity (weekly-meeting?/joint-lesson-observation?) with tutor participating.
 - 15min xxx and Allan - Catchup progress
 - 15min xxx (xxx?) and Allan - Summary and next steps

I have a booking system that is linked to my calendar availability to book school visits available at
https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/3e0385ef8fb340e38b6686624a78dda0@canterbury.ac.uk?anonymous&ep=pcard

My presence is purely to help and support.
Please fit this visit into a timescale that is comfortable for you.

Hope to see you soon.
Keep in touch.

Computing Mentor Visit - 

Hi xxx (as Computing Subject Mentor)
(cc'ing as part of process
  xxx as Professional Mentor
  xxx as Trainee Teacher
)

Thank you for booking a school visit slot via my online booking system.
I am due to visit tomorrow (Thursday 9th November 2023) between 11:00 and 13:00.
I hope to report to reception around 10:45.

The purpose of my visit is to support you with the mentoring process.

My initial thoughts for the timing of this visit could be:
 - 45min xxx and Allan - Discuss curriculum and progress 
 - 45min xxx, xxx and Allan - A normal mentoring activity (weekly-meeting?/joint-lesson-observation?) with tutor participating.
 - 15min xxx and Allan - Catchup progress
 - 15min xxx, (xxx?) and Allan - Summary and next steps
I'm happy for the order/timing to be flexible.

Some thoughts about my areas of focus:
 - Looking at xxx's ePortfolio, there are significant gaps appearing already. 
 - We should discuss the upcoming Student Progress Review 1 (SPR1) that is due in December and what this entails.

I'm looking forward to visiting tomorrow.
See you soon.
