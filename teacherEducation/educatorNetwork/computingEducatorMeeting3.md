AI in Teacher Education 
 We will be hosting an informal discussion around the following questions about AI in teacher education. We have asked some members to prepare their thoughts and then we will go into an open discussion on the following themes:

Are you teaching your student teachers to use AI to support with their teaching / workload? If so how are you doing this?
How are you supporting your teachers to support their pupils to learn about AI as part of the computing curriculum?
Are you using AI to support your student teachers experience of their ITE curriculum ? e.g for personalisation of learning or scenario generation.
