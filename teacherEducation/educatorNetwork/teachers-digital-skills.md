* advanced

When I consider it this way it is surprising how little digital competence is needed to deliver the current curriculum.

Of course there are many schools who consider digital competency as vital to develop in teachers, young people and leaders.
Some schools will have only developed certain elements based on lockdown learning and school improvement priorities e.g. Afl and digital - modelling with visualisers, diagnostic questions using multiple choice assessments.

Subject: Teachers' digital literacy

Dear all, at a recent event Miles reminded me that I was responsible for the inclusion of ICT skills in the standards for teachers – a long time ago.  I also remember losing an argument with the then TTA that we ought to identify this knowledge and skills first before spending £240 million on the NOF training for teachers. Ho hum.

I thought now might be a good time to revisit this and that it would be useful to get a bunch of people together to think through what a digital framework for (all) teachers’ digital competencies might look like.  
I did something similar for the Serbian government a few years ago. (Miles I think you spoke at the event in Belgrade where it was launched.)  
On the basis of that experience, I’m very much wedded to a development approach that goes something like:

* Identify what great teaching looks like in process terms – what teachers do or should/could do using digital tech
* Identify how digital tools could help them do this
* Identify the knowledge and skills that teachers would need to use these tools (specific to the tools and generic to using IT) consciously, effectively, safely.

That is,  start from teaching and learning not the tech.  (I think this is important because (1) it’s right and (2) because it gets buy in from the profession.)

I’m looking for a bunch of people to help.  Becci (cc’d) is identifying some folk from other curriculum areas, and I’ve contacted you as people who have previous in this area.  I don’t have a plan yet, other than get the right people on the bus, go through the three steps, then get it out there.  Step zero is to see if this seems useful (hence this  email.) 

Thoughts welcomed on whether there’s a need, whether the development process looks right, whether there’s thinking already in place eg in ITT providers …….  I’ve attached a very sketchy doc.

 

Best wishes,

Developing a BCS digital competence framework for teachers
1. Digital technology in the classroom
1.1. When used well, digital technology helps teachers bring subjects to life, tailor teaching to students’ needs, and monitor and track pupils’ progress.  Teachers can also use technology to extend their own professional learning, parents can be fully involved in their children’s school work, and the school as a whole can deliver better for its students.  
1.2. School ‘closures’ during the pandemic greatly increased the use of digital technology in schools. DfE’s 20/21 EdTech Survey following the school closures indicated positive impact on:
outcomes for pupils1
reducing teacher workload2
back-office efficiency3.
1.3. Teachers and headteachers expect these benefits to continue, however, teachers’ own competences with digital technology are fundamental4 if these benefits are to be realised in the future. In the words of Andreas Schleicher, OECD Director for Education and Skills “to deliver on the promises technology holds, countries need to ensure that teachers are at the forefront of designing and implementing this change.” 
2. Why develop a framework
1.4. Digital skills were a compulsory requirement of teachers’ initial training, however, this was removed over ten years ago as part of the slimming down of the requirements for teacher status.  As a result, there is huge variation in teachers’ digital skills, and this was reflected in schools’ ability to respond during the pandemic.  Some had the necessary skills and systems in place to respond quickly; others struggled. 
1.5. There is a need to set out the digital competencies that teachers need in the same way that the Digital Teaching Professional Framework5 (developed by the Education and Training Foundation and JISC) sets them out for the FE sector, including for learning providers in the workplace, community settings and prisons. The EU has developed a common European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu) which aims to ‘to provide a general reference frame for developers of Digital Competence models, i.e. Member States, regional governments, relevant national and regional agencies, educational organisations themselves, and public or private professional training providers.’6 These existing frameworks provide good starting points for developing a bespoke framework for teachers in the UK.  
1.6. What these existing frameworks share is a focus on how digital technologies can be used to enhance and innovate education rather than technical skills. Digital technology is positioned as a support for great teaching rather than an end in itself. This focus on teaching and the activities that support teaching should be maintained throughout the development of the framework and in its promotion.
3. Developing the Framework
1.7. A three step development is suggested:
STEP 1: Identify the processes that underpin great teaching – what teachers do that makes a difference.  This will include keeping their subject and pedagogical knowledge up to date, designing and resourcing great lessons, communicating and creating an effective classroom culture, formative and summative assessment, collaborating with other teachers, and analysing, collecting and learning from data.
STEP 2: Identify how the use of digital technology enhances and supports these processes.  This will include through the use of generic digital technologies and tools, and the use of more specific educational technologies.
STEP3: Identify the specific digital competencies needed to use digital technologies in these ways.  This will include specific competencies such as the use of search engines to locate resources, or a data visualisation tool, and enabling competencies, such as those needed to manage and work safely and securely with digital technology.

My Ideas
--------

* Collaborate with
    * Educators
        * Data (share)
        * Resources
            * House style / brand
            * Accessibility (layout separate to content) (see tech)
    * Students (directly related to teaching/learning)
        * Feedback
        * Distribute
        * Collect
        * Track
        * Engage (social? chat? community?) wiki?
        * Convey/Present
            * Projector? Distribute to devices?
            * Create (media, video?)
    * Parents
        * term? day? automated? behaviour? (style)
* Tech
    * Identify
        * Consider alternatives to mainstream tooling (not email)
            * Who will use/need this data, how often will it change, how will other people find it, is this duplicated elsewhere, how do I direct other users here, can it be accessed programmatically (api? automation?)
        * Categorisation, Locating (Search/Discoverability)
    * Judge (Risk, cost, longevity, portability)
    * Capture?
        * How
    * Process
        * Stats? Graphs?
    * Data?
        * National?
        * Historic?
    * Overload? protect? (wellbeing?)
* Interesting tech
    * Wiki
    * Version control
    * Permissions Graph
    * Automation (deploy to blackboard - notifications - website update)
        * API access
        * (teachers identify common workflows and request - unaware of potential)
    * Accessibility
        * Speech to text, text to speech, translation, llm simplification
* Digital Identity
    * Password? Password Manager? Authenticator, Face?

> Develop mindset of (when, how, tech) .. better equipped for next thing
    > You cant rewrite the curriculum every time bill gates has a new idea

> Digital Induction - all schools do things differently
    > case studies?

> I can create content that can be located and collaborated with others

> How do you conceptualise digital stuff

The Douglas Adams quote from the 1999 ICT PoS: "With scientific method, we took things apart to see how they work. Now with computers we can put things back together to see how they work, by modelling complex, interrelated processes, even life itself. This is a new age of discovery, and ICT is the gateway.
