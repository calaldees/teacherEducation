ITT CCF
-------

* Adaptive Teaching (Standard 5–‘Adapt teaching’)
    * Learn That
        1. Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed
        2. Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success
        3. Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils
        4. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential
    * Learn How to
        * Identifying pupils who need new content further broken down.
* Professional Behaviours (Standard 8–‘Fulfil wider professional responsibilities’)
    1. Building effective relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success
    2. Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.
    3. SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils

        * 1st was own subject knowledge

The gap between students can become huge very quickly ...

ITT CCF 
* > 4.10 How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation
* > 5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.

### Mixed ability grouping

* [Patterns, Determinants, and Consequences of Ability Tracking: Evidence from Texas Public Schools](https://www.edworkingpapers.com/ai22-638)
    * > Schools often track students to classes based on ability.  .... we find positive effects on high-achieving students with no negative effects on low-achieving students, suggesting that tracking may increase inequality by raising the ceiling.

* [Mixed-attainment teaching: Careful steps towards better outcomes](https://impact.chartered.college/article/ehrlich_mixed-attainment-teaching-outcomes/) May 2018 Impact- Chartered College of Teaching
    * > children working in groups with others working at the same level of attainment – has been found to have a number of negative impacts on pupils, yet teachers often cite it as necessary for differentiating and meeting targets (Francis et al., 2017)
    * > As I feared, switching to mixed-attainment groupings initially proved to be a nightmare. Higher attainers dominated, lower attainers withdrew, arguments arose and little work seemed to get done.
    * Group composition
    * Student skills to develop
        * listening, sharing and respecting each other’s right to learn were all identified as being areas in need of work
        * highlights specific children who might need extra help developing these skills. This can be done through individual discussions and interventions.
        * treat pupils fairly (don't let high attainers get away with bad behaviour)
    * Lesson design
        * A lot of time was spent thinking about how to create lessons that were more open-ended and less teacher-centred, and which involved pupils having specific roles. Once this becomes the norm, it is no lengthier than designing three different tasks for your ‘tops, middles and bottoms’.
        * Open-ended tasks are far more successful at challenging all levels when planned well. In redesigning learning tasks, by using targeted questions and designated roles and allowing pupils to select their own level of challenge
        * the introduction of meta-learning and empowering pupils to take control of their learning
    * Impact on behaviour
        * as well as stepping back from the learning, teachers can step back from behaviour management too. Perhaps partly because of reduced anxiety about performing in the ‘top’ group or being stuck in the bottom group, pupils who initially misbehaved in group work stopped doing so. Having pupils determine learning rules and uphold them among each other also developed far better behaviour throughout the class. This, combined with the focus on meta-learning and encouraging respect for each other as learners, provides opportunities for pupils to take more responsibility for their own learning and make a real contribution to the group

    * Teacher introduces rule (if lucky teacher might explain why) - students reproduce 20 times
    * In japan one method - students in groups come up with as many ways as possible - 13 ways (Japanese teachers know this)
    * Differentiation comes from the teacher asking probing questions and ramping up cognitive demand
    * not separate tasks - teacher stretching groups

### Cooperative and Problem-Based Learning

        * Active participants in their learning, sharing and exchanging ideas
        * Increased positive attitude. Feels easier for them to learn.
    * Weakness
        * Much more time to be implemented properly
        * Difficult to manage
        * Difficult to choose balanced groups that work well together

My Tips

* Model meta cognition commentary in solving the problem
* Some Open ended tasks? 
    * Set the problem - 'create a program to'
* Some Creative tasks?
* Collaboration
* Independence/Autonomy
* Dialogue

When talking to your whole class, think "Who do I need here now?" Is to too high level for some? is it too low level for others?

Inclusive Society?
------------------

Discussion:
You have read that as teachers we are duty-bound to include all students of all possible ability's, backgrounds, races, genders, disabilities, ethnicity's, etc.
We are an inclusive society.

TASK: (15min)
With that in mind ... carefully discuss as a group the role of
* Single sex schools
* Grammar schools
* Special schools (do you as a teacher have the skills/training to support all of the required needs?)

* If you separated children based on other attributes - there would be an outcry. Why are some separations acceptable?

* [Pupil Premium](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium/pupil-premium)
    * Publicly-funded schools in England get extra funding from the government to help them improve the attainment of their disadvantaged pupils.
    * Evidence shows that children from disadvantaged backgrounds:
        * generally face extra challenges in reaching their potential at school
        * often do not perform as well as their peers
    * The pupil premium grant is designed to allow schools to help disadvantaged pupils by improving their progress and the exam results they achieve.
    * Schools get ... £935 for every secondary age pupil, who claims free school meals, or who has claimed free school meals in the last 6 years.
    * Schools get £2,300 for every pupil who has left local authority care through adoption

        * achievement (e.g. individual and small group tuition, personalised homework support and online learning packages) 
        * independence (e.g. weekly work experience opportunities for individuals)

### Metrics of disadvantage?

    * Some parents don't know they can apply for this
* Attendance?
    * moving home? devoice?
* Social Services? foster?

        * > Underlying the medical model is the belief that the difficulties associated with a disability should be borne wholly by the disabled person, 
            > and that the disabled person should make an extra effort (perhaps in time, effort, money, etc.) to ensure they do not inconvenience anyone else. 
            > They must change and adapt to fit the circumstances and their environment such as attending university.
    * Social model of disability -> person needs support -> low-income, negative attitudes, badly designed buildings
    * > your responsibility to ensure that your learning and teaching activities and materials are accessible.

Mental heath of teenages
Suicide - self harm


Covid - poorest most affected

My PE Teacher - run times - small, slow, poor cordination (throw/catch) - handwriting illegable/unmarkable , spelling non existent



Most children do not fit into neatly into a category
I take them as a guide, but focus on children as individuals

        * David Andrews
            * > This experiment highlights the problems inherent in running mixed-ability classes, and makes it clear that any techniques used to increase access to participation for the students on either side of the class average (in terms of ability) will only ever be compromises.
            * This is a comment from a non specialist - the research says otherwise

Gender

* [Female Performance and Participation in Computer Science: A National Picture](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3366016) Kemp 2019
    * > Female participation remains a concern in most jurisdictions, but female attainment in CS is relatively unstudied
    * > we find that females from the poorest areas were more likely to take CS than those from the richest areas and that CS was more popular among ethnic minority females than white females
    * > CS females typically got better grades than their male peers. However, when controlling for average attainment in other subjects, males got 0.31 of a grade higher. Female relative underperformance in CS was most acute among large female cohorts and with girls studying in mixed-gender schools
    * > The move to introduce CS into the English curriculum and the removal of the ICT qualifications look to be having a negative impact on female participation and attainment in computing. Using the theory of self-efficacy, we argue that the shift towards CS might decrease the number of girls choosing further computing qualifications or pursuing computing as a career. Computing curriculum designers and teachers need to carefully consider the inclusive nature of their computing courses.

cultural inclusion

White british students are unable to identify things that are part of their culture

TODO? Where to put this?
Don't use the word _ability_. This implies a ceiling. Use the word _attainment_
