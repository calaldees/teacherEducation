            * Craig’s Five Golden Rules for Diagnostic Questions
                * They should be clear and unambiguous
                * They should test a single skill or concept
                * Students should be able to answer in less than 20 seconds
                    * More than this means learner is making multiple steps; hard to pin down specific misconception
                * You should learn something from each incorrect response (without the student needing to explain their process)
                * It is not possible to answer the question correctly whilst still holding a key misconception
            * The following questions and prompts can be used with students who are answering the diagnostic questions:
                * Support
                    * Are there any answers you can rule out?
                    * Which answer looks the most sensible?
                    * What topic in the curriculum is this?
                * Extension
                    * Write the best explanation you possibly can for the correct answer
                    * Convince me why each of the alternative answers is wrong
                    * Can you explain what misconception someone has who chooses each of the incorrect answers?
                    * What other alternative incorrect answers would you have included, and why?
                    * Can you write some questions that would make each of the wrong answers correct?
                    * Create your own diagnostic question on this topic, explaining your reasoning behind each of your three incorrect answers
            * Get feedback from students. Get them to tell you 'why' they think that is the answer
                * Find the worst 3 answered questions
                * Step 5: Find the most popular misconceptions and read explanations written by students
                * Step 7: As a teacher - Ask 3 questions:
                    * Where do students go wrong?
                    * Why do they go wrong?
                    * What are we going to do about it?

### Criticality

* > Incorrect answers can distract pupils and reinforce misconceptions
    * Roedinger, KarPicke - Qfsted computing research review
* Many facets of Computing are a combination of concepts - leading to diagnostic questions loosing value as skills improve
* The students don't engage and guess - you get misleading results


Hinge Questions
---------------

Slightly different concept to diagnostic questions

* [STEM Learning - Assessment for Learning - "Hinge Point" Questions](https://www.stem.org.uk/assessment-for-learning)
    * multiple correct answers are included to make it difficult for students to get the correct answer for the wrong reason.
    * the incorrect distractor answers have been purposefully chosen and they link to alternative conceptions or ideas.
* [Improving Teaching](https://improvingteaching.co.uk/) Harry Fletcher-Wood [@HFletcherWood](https://twitter.com/HFletcherWood)
    * [Hinge Questions](https://improvingteaching.co.uk/hinge-questions-hub/) ImprovingTeaching.co.uk
        * [Do they understand this well enough to move on? Introducing hinge questions](https://improvingteaching.co.uk/2013/08/17/do-they-understand-this-well-enough-to-move-on-introducing-hinge-questions/)
            * [Oiling the hinges – refining my construction of hinge questions](https://improvingteaching.co.uk/2013/11/03/oiling-the-hinges-refining-my-construction-of-hinge-question/)
                * > Whatever a student chooses, I will know what they were thinking, that they can only have been thinking that, and that there’s nothing else they might have thought of that I’ve missed.

### My example of hinge

Taking from Harry Fletcher Wood.
* Have a question with 6(?) responses
    * with multiple answers being 'true/correct'
        * Not a guessing/most likely - have to think about each one
    * Even none of them being correct
    * Each wrong selection will reveal a misconception
* (show example of my socrative - https://b.socrative.com/teacher/#results/75196146/questions/5 )
    * Look at the wrong
    * Students can justify why they put that answer - sometimes they are correct - this really makes you think about your wording
    * Give them time to write why the incorrect answer was wrong in workbooks (?)



Summary
=======

* TASK: Describe how diagnostic questions are different from hinge questions
* To use these - questions need to be planned carefully in advance!
