Project: Escape Room
====================

### Escape room idea

* [[creativity]]

Disclaimer.
We are time bound.
You may only have 1 hour of KS3 a week. 
To do a project like this you may need a significant investment in time. 
This may be too much for your current SOW and KS3 program. 
This is a _possible concept_ it is not a fully formed or trailed idea.


* Demo the concept of an escape room.
    * Show videos? Bring in equipment? Bring in a guest speaker? Enthuse them.
* Explore the sensors
    * Structured time to use the sensors - suggest a structured activity on the VLE for each one
        * See the Pi helpsheets at
            * [Project-based learning: A path to agency](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/articles/hw12-project-based-learning) 2020
        * Maybe split into pairs? try a sensor each and report back?
* Introduce project
    * Individually or in pairs
        * Design and create the code for an escape room puzzle that uses a microbit
            * When a code is entered - unlock a box
            * When a door is opened trigger something
            * Might be a scrambled message on paper that if they match the symbols on paper to the microbit they can decode the message
            * (The goal is not to actually build it thematically visibly, you may create the electronics physically)
        * Consider partnering with 2 other groups to create a theme
            * Haunted house
            * Derelict spaceship
            * Egyptian tomb
    * Assessment criteria
        * Be clear your assessment is of _use of Computing skills_ rather than artwork created to go with the puzzle
        * use of external input
            * buttons sensor
            * relay/magnet
        * use of external output
            * speaker
            * motor
            * magnetic latch
            * led
        * use of radio communication
            * describe the protocol
            * Transmission? Error handling? Ack?
        * use of a loop
        * use of storage
            * array?
        * use blocks
        * use code
            * code only features
        * collaboration with other teams - protocol design? hardware integration with others
        * marks for puzzle concept
    * Support materials
        * The Microbit simulator provides an accessible development environment before reaching for the hardware
        * List of basic project suggestions
            * Some weaker students will not no where to start. Give them a choice of three possible achievable simple projects
                * Cycle led's through a pattern. The puzzle is to press the button when the LED's are in a particular arrangement. The arrangement could be found by decoding a message on paper.
        * Setup a class wiki for the project
        * Some links to some more advanced tools
            * Links to Youtube videos? other tutorials/resources? on how to use a depth-sensor?
        * Record a video of you creating a starting project that demos the core skills (could be done live in class and recorded)
    * Assessment could be
        * Video of a them describing to other/students how it works
        * A poster describing how it works
        * Annotated code with comments mapped to assessment criteria
        * Each student can be accountable for a different part of the overall escape room project - it's important that students have individual accountability
    * Demo at open evening?
